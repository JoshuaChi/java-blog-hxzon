CHAPTER 4 Controllers and State

注释by hxzon
========
Historically, state was managed server side with session cookies. So, whenever users
navigated  to a new page, the previous page’s state was lost—only the cookies persisted.
JavaScript applications, however, are confined to a single page, which means we can
now store state on the client's memory.
因为是单页面应用，所以状态存储在客户端内存中。

One of the major advantages to storing state on the client is a really responsive interface.
A user gets immediate feedback when interacting with the page, rather than waiting a
few seconds for the next page to load. Speed greatly improves the user experience,
making many JavaScript applications a real pleasure to use.

However, storing state on the client causes challenges as well. Where exactly should it
be stored? In local variables? Perhaps in the DOM? This is where a lot of developers get
led astray, which is an unfortunate state of affairs because storing state properly is one
of the most critical areas to get right.

First, you should avoid storing data or state in the DOM. That’s just a slippery slope
leading to an entangled mess and anarchy! In our case—since we’re using the tried and
tested MVC architecture—state is stored inside our application’s controllers.
首先，避免将数据储存在dom中。

What exactly is a controller? Well, you can think of it as the glue between the application’s views and models. 
It’s the only component aware of the application’s views
and models, tying them together. When the page loads, your controller attaches event
handlers to views and processes callbacks appropriately, interfacing with models as
necessary.

You don’t need any libraries to create controllers, although they can be useful. The only
essential part is that controllers are modular and independent. Ideally, they shouldn’t
be defining any global variables, instead functioning as fairly decoupled components.
An excellent way of ensuring this is with the module pattern.

====
Module Pattern
模块模式

The module pattern is a great way to encapsulate logic and prevent global namespace 
pollution. It’s all made possible by anonymous functions, which are arguably the single
best feature of JavaScript. We’ll just create an anonymous function and execute it im-mediately. 
All the code residing within the function runs inside a closure, providing a
local and private environment for our application’s variables:
通过“匿名立即执行函数”实现模块功能。

(function(){
/* ... */
})();

We have to surround the anonymous function with braces ()before we can execute it.
JavaScript requires this so it can interpret the statement correctly.

====
Global Import
全局变量导入

Variable definitions inside the module are local, so they can’t be accessed outside in
the global namespace. However, the application’s global variables are all still available,
and they can be readily accessed and manipulated inside the module. It’s often not
obvious which global variables are being used by a module, especially when your modules get larger.

In addition, implied globals are slower to resolve because the JavaScript interpreter has
to walk up the scope chain to resolve them. Local variable access will always be faster
and more efficient.
避免直接使用全局变量，因为速度较慢。

Luckily, our modules provide an easy way to resolve these problems. By passing globals
as parameters to our anonymous function, we can import them into our code, which
is both clearer and faster than implied globals:
将要使用的全局变量，作为“匿名立即执行函数”的参数。

(function($){
/* ... */
})(jQuery);


In the example above, we’re importing the global variable jQuery into our module and
aliasing it to  $. It’s obvious which global variables are being accessed inside the module,
and their lookup is quicker. In fact, this is the  recommended practice whenever you
want to use jQuery’s $ shortcut, which ensures that your code won’t conflict with any
other libraries.

====
Global Export
全局导出

We can use a similar technique when it comes to exporting global variables. Ideally,
you should be using as few global variables as possible, but there’s always the odd
occasion when they’re needed. We can import the page’s window into our module, 
setting properties on it directly, thereby exposing variables globally:

(function($, exports){
exports.Foo = "wem";
})(jQuery, window);
assertEqual( Foo, "wem" );

The fact that we’re using a variable called  exports to set any global variables means the
code is clearer, making it obvious which global variables a module is creating.

====
Adding a Bit of Context
上下文

Using a local context is a useful way of structuring modules, especially when it comes
to registering callbacks to events. As it stands, the context inside our module is global—
this is equal to window:
在匿名立即执行函数里，this指向window。

(function(){
	assertEqual( this, window );
})();

If we want to scope the context, we need to start adding functions onto an object. For
example:
我们创建一个新对象，在这个新对象上添加函数。

(function(){
    var mod = {};
    mod.contextFunction = function(){
        assertEqual( this, mod );
    };
    mod.contextFunction();
})();

The context inside contextFunction() is now local to our  mod object. We can start using
this without worrying about creating global variables. To give you a better indication
of how it would be used in practice, let’s further flesh out that example:

(function($){
    var mod = {};
    mod.load = function(func){
        $($.proxy(func, this));
    };
    mod.load(function(){
        this.view = $("#view");
    });
    mod.assetsClick = function(e){
        // Process click
    };
    
    mod.load(function(){
        this.view.find(".assets").click(
            $.proxy(this.assetsClick, this)
        );
    });
})(jQuery);

We’re creating a load() function that takes a callback, executing it when the page has
loaded. Notice that we’re using jQuery.proxy() to ensure that the callback is invoked
in the correct context.

Then, when the page loads, we’re adding a click handler onto an element, giving it a
local function,  assetsClick(), as a callback. Creating a controller doesn’t need to be
any more complicated than that. What’s important is that all of the controller’s state
is kept local and encapsulated cleanly into a module.

====
Abstracting into a Library
抽象化：控制器模块

Let’s abstract that library out so we can reuse it with other modules and controllers.
We’ll include the existing load() function and add new ones like  proxy() and  include():

(function($, exports){
    var mod = function(includes){//hxzon：作为构造函数使用
        if (includes) this.include(includes);
    };
    mod.fn = mod.prototype;
    mod.fn.proxy = function(func){
        return $.proxy(func, this);
    };
    mod.fn.load = function(func){
        $(this.proxy(func));
    };
    mod.fn.include = function(ob){
        $.extend(this, ob);
    };
    exports.Controller = mod;
})(jQuery, window);

proxy() ensures that functions are executed in the local context, which is a useful pattern for event callbacks. 
The  include() function is just a shortcut for adding properties
onto the controller, saving some typing.

We’re adding our library to the exports object, exposing it as the global  Controller
variable. Inside the module we can instantiate a  Controller object using its constructor
function. Let’s go through a simple example that toggles an element’s class depending
on whether the mouse is over the element:
示例：创建一个新控制器类

(function($, Controller){
    var mod = new Controller;
    mod.toggleClass = function(e){ 
        this.view.toggleClass("over", e.data);
    };
    mod.load(function(){
        this.view = $("#view");
        this.view.mouseover(this.proxy(this.toggleClass), true);
        this.view.mouseout(this.proxy(this.toggleClass), false);
    });
})(jQuery, Controller);

When the page loads, we’re creating a  view variable and attaching some event listeners.
They in turn call toggleClass() when the mouse moves over the element, toggling the
element’s class. You can see the full example in this book’s accompanying files, in
assets/ch04/modules.html.

Granted, using context rather than local variables means there is probably more code
to write, what with all the usage of  this. However, the technique gives us much greater
scope for reusing code and including mixins. For example, we could add a function
onto every Controller instance by setting a property on its prototype:
这种方式可以更好的实现代码复用，就像“混入”。
可以给每个控制器实例添加新方法。

Controller.fn.unload = function(func){
    jQuery(window).bind("unload", this.proxy(func));
};

Or, we could extend an individual controller by using the  include() function we defined
earlier, passing it an object:

var mod = new Controller;
mod.include(StateMachine);

The StateMachine object, in this example, could be reused over and over again with our
other modules, preventing us from duplicating code and keeping things DRY (don’t
repeat yourself).

====
Loading Controllers After the Document
加载控制器

As it stands, some parts of our controllers are being loaded before the DOM, and other
parts are in callbacks to be invoked after the page’s document has loaded. This can be
confusing because the controller’s logic is being executed under different states, 
resulting in a lot of document load callbacks.

We can solve this in one fell swoop by loading controllers after the DOM. I personally
advocate this approach because it ensures that you don’t need to think constantly about
what state the page’s DOM is in when accessing elements.

Let’s first take advantage and clear up our library, making our controllers a bit cleaner.
The  Controller  class doesn’t need to be a constructor function because the context
switch needed when generating subcontrollers is unnecessary here:
改进。控制器不需要一个构造函数，
因为我们不需要创建子控制器，所以也就不需要上下文切换。（hxzon：注意）

// Use global context, rather than the window
// object, to create global variables
var exports = this;
(function($){
    var mod = {};
    mod.create = function(includes){//hxzon：返回一个构造函数
        var result = function(){//hxzon：构造函数
            this.init.apply(this, arguments);
        };
        result.fn = result.prototype;
        result.fn.init = function(){};
        result.proxy = function(func){ return $.proxy(func, this); };
        result.fn.proxy = result.proxy;
        result.include = function(ob){ $.extend(this.fn, ob); }; 
        result.extend = function(ob){ $.extend(this, ob); };
        if (includes) result.include(includes);
        return result;
    };
    exports.Controller = mod;
})(jQuery);

Now we can use our new Controller.create() function to create controllers, passing
in an object literal of instance properties. Notice that the entire controller is wrapped
in  jQuery(function(){ /* ... */ }). This is an alias for  jQuery.ready(), and it ensures
that the controller is loaded only after the page’s DOM has fully initialized:
现在，通过Controller.create() 方法来创建控制器类。

jQuery(function($){
    var ToggleView = Controller.create({
        init: function(view){
            this.view = $(view);
            this.view.mouseover(this.proxy(this.toggleClass), true);
            this.view.mouseout(this.proxy(this.toggleClass), false); 
        },
        this.toggleClass: function(e){2
            this.view.toggleClass("over", e.data); 
        }
    });
    // Instantiate controller, calling init()
    new ToggleView("#view");//hxzon：创建一个控制器实例
});

The other significant change we’ve made is passing in the view element to the controller
upon instantiation, rather than hardcoding it inside. This is an important refinement
because it means we can start reusing controllers with different elements, keeping code
repetition to a minimum.

====
Accessing Views
访问视图

A common pattern is to have one controller per view. That view has an ID, so it can be
passed to controllers easily. Elements inside the view then use classes, rather than IDs,
so they don’t conflict with elements in other views. 
This pattern provides a good structure for a general practice, but it should not be conformed to rigidly.

So far in this chapter we’ve been accessing views by using the  jQuery() selector, storing
a local reference to the view inside the controller. Subsequent searches for elements
inside the view are then scoped by that view reference, speeding up their lookup:

// ... 
init: function(view){
    this.view = $(view);
    this.form = this.view.find("form");
}

However, it does mean that controllers fill up with a lot of selectors, requiring us to
query the DOM constantly. We can clean this up somewhat by having one place in the
controller where selectors are mapped to variables names, like so:
将css选择器映射到变量（自动创建本地变量）。（hxzon：有用的思想）

elements: {
    "form.searchForm": "searchForm",
    "form input[type=text]": "searchInput"
}

This ensures that the variables this.searchForm and this.searchInput will be created
on the controller when it’s instantiated, set to their respective elements. 
These are normal jQuery objects, so we can manipulate them as usual, setting event handlers and
fetching attributes.

Let’s implement support for that  elements mapping inside our controllers, iterating
over all the selectors and setting local variables. 
We’ll do this inside our init() function, which is called when our controller is instantiated:

var exports = this;
jQuery(function($){
	exports.SearchView = Controller.create({
		// Map of selectors to local variable names
		elements: {
			"input[type=search]": "searchInput",
			"form": "searchForm"
		},
	
		// Called upon instantiation
		init: function(element){
			this.el = $(element);
			this.refreshElements();
			this.searchForm.submit(this.proxy(this.search));
		},
		search: function(){
			console.log("Searching:", this.searchInput.val());
		},
		// Private
		$: function(selector){
			// An `el` property is required, and scopes the query
			return $(selector, this.el);
		},
		// Set up the local variables
		refreshElements: function(){
			for (var key in this.elements) {
				this[this.elements[key]] = this.$(key);//hxzon：自动创建本地变量
			}
		}
	});
	new SearchView("#users");
});

refreshElements()  expects every controller to have a current element property,  el,
which will scope any selectors. Once  refreshElements() is called, the  this.searchForm
and  this.searchInput properties will be set on the controller and are subsequently
available for event binding and DOM manipulation.

You can see a full example of this in this book’s accompanying files, in  assets/ch04/
views.html.

====
Delegating Events
处理事件

We can also take a stab at cleaning up all that event binding and proxying by having
an events object that maps event types and selectors to callbacks. This is going to be
very similar to the elements object, but instead will take the following form:
将事件映射到回调函数。

events: {
    "submit form": "submit"
}

Let’s go ahead and add that to our SearchView controller. Like  refreshElements(), we’ll
have a  delegateEvents() function that will be called when the controller is instantiated.
This will parse the controller’s events object, attaching event callbacks. In our SearchView
example, we want the  search() function to be invoked whenever the view’s
<form />is submitted:

var exports = this;

jQuery(function($){
    exports.SearchView = Controller.create({
        // Map all the event names, 
        // selectors, and callbacks
        events: {
            "submit form": "search"
        },
        init: function(){
            // ...
            this.delegateEvents();
        },
        search: function(e){ /* ... */ },

        // Private
        // Split on the first space
        eventSplitter: /^(\w+)\s*(.*)$/,

        delegateEvents: function(){
            for (var key in this.events) {
                var methodName = this.events[key];
                var method = this.proxy(this[methodName]);
                var match = key.match(this.eventSplitter);
                var eventName = match[1], selector = match[2];
                if (selector === '') {
                    this.el.bind(eventName, method);
                } else {
                    this.el.delegate(selector, eventName, method);
                }
            }//end for
        }
});

Notice  we’re using the  delegate() function inside  delegateEvents(), as well as the
bind() function. If the event selector isn’t provided, the event will be placed straight
on el. Otherwise, the event will be delegated, and it will be triggered if the event type
is fired on a child matching the selector. The advantage of delegation is that it often
reduces the amount of event listeners required—i.e., listeners don’t have to be placed
on every element selected because events are caught dynamically when they bubble up.

We can push all those controller enhancements upstream to our Controller library so
they can be reused in every controller. Here’s the finished example; you can find the
full controller library in assets/ch04/finished_controller.html:

var exports = this;
jQuery(function($){
    exports.SearchView = Controller.create({
        elements: {
            "input[type=search]": "searchInput",
        
            "form": "searchForm"
        },
        events: {
            "submit form": "search"
        },
        init: function(){ /* ... */ },
        search: function(){
            alert("Searching: " + this.searchInput.val());
            return false;
        },
    });
    new SearchView({el: "#users"});
});

=========
State Machines
有限状态机（hxzon：重点理解。对this的处理，未完全理解）

State  machines—or to use their proper term, Finite State Machines(FSMs)—are a great
way to program UIs. Using state machines, you can easily manage multiple controllers,
showing and hiding views as necessary. So, what exactly is a state machine? At its core,
a state machine consists of two things: states and transitions. It has only one active
状态机包含两个部分：状态，转换。每个时刻，状态机都只处于其中一个状态。
state, but it has a multitude of passive states. When the active state switches, transitions
between the states are called.

How does this work in practice? Well, consider having a few application views that
need to be displayed independently—say, a view for showing contacts and a view for
editing contacts. These two views need to be displayed exclusively—when one is
shown, the other view needs to be hidden. This is a perfect scenario to introduce a state
machine because it will ensure that only one view is active at any given time. Indeed,
if we want to add additional views, such as a settings view, using a state machine makes
this trivial.
示例：两个视图之间切换。

Let’s flesh out a practical example that will give you a good idea of how state machines
can be implemented. The example is simple and doesn’t cater to different transition
types, but it is sufficient for our needs. First, we’re going to create an  Events object that
will use jQuery’s event API (as discussed in Chapter 2) to add the ability to bind and
trigger events on our state machine:

var Events = {
    bind: function(){
        if ( !this.o ) this.o = $({});
        this.o.bind.apply(this.o, arguments);//hxzon：？将Events的这两个方法的this，都绑定到一个内部对象o上。何用？
    },
    trigger: function(){
        if ( !this.o ) this.o = $({});
        this.o.trigger.apply(this.o, arguments);
    }
};

The Events object is essentially extending jQuery’s existing event support outside the
DOM so that we can use it in our own library. Now let’s set about creating the State
Machine class, which will have one main function, add():

var StateMachine = function(){};
StateMachine.fn = StateMachine.prototype;

// Add event binding/triggering
$.extend(StateMachine.fn, Events);

StateMachine.fn.add = function(controller){
    this.bind("change", function(e, current){
        if (controller == current)
            controller.activate();
        else
            controller.deactivate();
    });
    controller.active = $.proxy(function(){
        this.trigger("change", controller);//hxzon：通过代理，这里的this指向状态机实例，否则会指向控制器实例
    }, this);
};

The state machine’s add() function adds the passed controller to the list of states and
creates an active() function. When  active() is called, the active state will transition
to the controller. The state machine will call  activate() on the active controller and
deactivate() on all the other controllers. We can see how this works by creating two
通过状态机的add方法，可以添加一个控制器到状态机中，并为这个控制器添加了一个active方法。
当调用控制器的active方法时，状态机的状态会迁移到此控制器。
然后调用此控制器的activate方法，并调用所有其它控制器的deactivate方法。
example controllers, adding them to the state machine, and then activating one of them:

var con1 = {
    activate: function(){ /* ... */ },
    deactivate: function(){ /* ... */ }
};
var con2 = {
    activate: function(){ /* ... */ },
    deactivate: function(){ /* ... */ }
};
// Create a new StateMachine and add states
var sm = new StateMachine;
sm.add(con1);
sm.add(con2);
// Activate first state
con1.active();

The state machine’s add() function works by creating a callback for the change event,
calling the  activate() or deactivate() function, depending on which is appropriate.
Although the state machine gives us an active() function, we can also change the state
by manually triggering the change event:

sm.trigger("change", con2);

Inside our controller’s activate() function, we can set up and display its view, adding
and showing elements. Likewise, inside the deactivate() function, we can tear down
anything that is hiding the view. CSS classes offer a good way of hiding and showing
views. Simply add a class—say, .active—when the view is active, and remove it upon
deactivation:

var con1 = {
    activate: function(){
        $("#con1").addClass("active");
    },
    deactivate: function(){ 
        $("#con1").removeClass("active");
    }
};
var con2 = {
    activate: function(){
        $("#con2").addClass("active");
    },
    deactivate: function(){ 
        $("#con2").removeClass("active");
    }
};

Then, in your stylesheets, make sure that the views have a  .active class; otherwise,
they’re hidden:

#con1, #con2 { display: none; }
#con1.active, #con2.active { display: block; }

You can see the full examples in assets/ch04/state_machine.html.
