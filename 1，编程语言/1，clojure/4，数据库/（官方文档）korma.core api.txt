Core querying and entity functions

====
aggregate

macro
(aggregate query agg alias & [group-by])

Use a SQL aggregator function, aliasing the results, and optionally grouping by
a field:

聚合函数，为结果集指定别名，以及指定分组字段（可选）。

(select users
  (aggregate (count :*) :cnt :status))

Aggregates available: count, sum, avg, min, max, first, last

====
as-sql

(as-sql query)
Force a query to return a string of SQL when (exec) is called.

返回生成的sql字符串。

====
belongs-to

macro
(belongs-to ent sub-ent & [opts])

Add a belongs-to relationship for the given entity. It is assumed that the foreign key
is on the current entity with the format sub-ent-table_id: email.user_id = user.id.
Can optionally pass a map with a :fk key to explicitly set the foreign key.

(belongs-to users email {:fk :emailID})

本实体需持有一个外键字段。可以用 :fk 指定外键字段名。

====
create-entity

(create-entity table)

Create an entity representing a table in a database.

====
database

(database ent db)

Set the database connection to be used for this entity.
设置实体的数据库。

====
defentity

macro
(defentity ent & body)

Define an entity representing a table in the database, applying any modifications in
the body.

====
delete

macro
(delete ent & body)

Creates a delete query, applies any modifying functions in the body and then
executes it. `ent` is either a string or an entity created by defentity.

ex: (delete user
      (where {:id 7}))

====
delete*

(delete* ent)

Create an empty delete query. Ent can either be an entity defined by defentity,
or a string of the table name

====
dry-run

macro
(dry-run & body)

Wrap around a set of queries to print to the console all SQL that would
be run and return dummy values instead of executing them.

打印生成的sql语句，并返回一个伪造的结果集。

====
entity-fields

(entity-fields ent & fields)

Set the fields to be retrieved by default in select queries for the
entity.
设置实体默认返回的字段。

====
exec

(exec query)

Execute a query map and return the results.

====
exec-raw

(exec-raw conn? & [sql with-results?])

Execute a raw SQL string, supplying whether results should be returned. `sql`
can either be a string or a vector of the sql string and its params. You can
also optionally provide the connection to execute against as the first
parameter.

(exec-raw ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?" [5]] :results)

字符串，参数向量。

====
fields

(fields query & vs)

Set the fields to be selected in a query. Fields can either be a keyword
or a vector of two keywords [field alias]:

(fields query :name [:firstname :first])

设置select子句的查询字段，以及字段别名。

====
from

(from query table)

Add tables to the from clause.

====
group

(group query & fields)

Add a group-by clause to a select query

====
has-many

macro
(has-many ent sub-ent & [opts])

Add a has-many relation for the given entity. It is assumed that the foreign key
is on the sub-entity with the format table_id: user.id = email.user_id
Can optionally pass a map with a :fk key to explicitly set the foreign key.

(has-many users email {:fk :emailID})

====
has-one

macro
(has-one ent sub-ent & [opts])

Add a has-one relationship for the given entity. It is assumed that the foreign key
is on the sub-entity with the format table_id: user.id = address.user_id
Can optionally pass a map with a :fk key to explicitly set the foreign key.

(has-one users address {:fk :addressID})

====
having

macro
(having query form)

Add a having clause to the query, expressing the clause in clojure expressions
with keywords used to reference fields.
e.g. (having query (or (= :hits 1) (> :hits 5)))

Available predicates: and, or, =, not=, <, >, <=, >=, in, like, not, between

Having can also take a map at any point and will create a clause that compares
keys to values. The value can be a vector with one of the above predicate
functions describing how the key is related to the value:
  (having query {:name [like "chris"})

Having only works if you have an aggregation, using it without one will cause
an error.

having必须和聚集函数一起使用。

====
having*

(having* query clause)

Add a having clause to the query. Clause can be either a map or a string, and
will be AND'ed to the other clauses.

====
insert

macro
(insert ent & body)

Creates an insert query, applies any modifying functions in the body and then
executes it. `ent` is either a string or an entity created by defentity. Inserts
return the last inserted id.

      (order :name))

====
intersect*

(intersect*)

Create an empty intersect query.

====
join

macro
(join query ent)
(join query type ent)
(join query table clause)
(join query type table clause)

Add a join clause to a select query, specifying an entity defined by defentity, or the table name to
join and the predicate to join on. If the entity relationship uses a join
table then two clauses will be added. Otherwise, only one clause
will be added.

(join query addresses)
(join query :right addresses)
(join query addresses (= :addres.users_id :users.id))
(join query :right addresses (= :address.users_id :users.id))

====
limit

(limit query v)
Add a limit clause to a select query.

====
many-to-many

macro
(many-to-many ent sub-ent join-table & [opts])

Add a many-to-many relation for the given entity.  It is assumed that a join
table is used to implement the relationship and that the foreign keys are in

Call an arbitrary SQL function by providing func as a symbol or keyword
and its params

====
sqlfn*

(sqlfn* fn-name & params)

Call an arbitrary SQL function by providing the name of the function
and its params

====
subselect

macro
(subselect & parts)

Create a subselect clause to be used in queries. This works exactly like
(select ...) execept it will wrap the query in ( .. ) and make sure it can be
used in any current query:

(select users
  (where {:id [in (subselect users2 (fields :id))]}))

子查询语句。

====
table

(table ent t & [alias])

Set the name of the table and an optional alias to be used for the entity.

      (queries (subselect user
                 (where {:id 7}))
               (subselect user-backup
                 (where {:id 7})))

                 (where {:id 7}))
               (subselect user-backup
                 (where {:id 7})))
      (order :name))

====

====
update

macro
(update ent & body)

Creates an update query, applies any modifying functions in the body and then
executes it. `ent` is either a string or an entity created by defentity.
Returns number of updated rows as provided by the JDBC driver.

ex: (update user
      (set-fields {:name "chris"})
      (where {:id 4}))

====
update*

(update* ent)

Create an empty update query. Ent can either be an entity defined by defentity,
or a string of the table name.

====
values

(values query values)

Add records to an insert clause. values can either be a vector of maps or a
single map.

(values query [{:name "john"} {:name "ed"}])

插入语句中的字段名和值。

====
where

macro
(where query form)

Add a where clause to the query, expressing the clause in clojure expressions
with keywords used to reference fields.
e.g. (where query (or (= :hits 1) (> :hits 5)))

Available predicates: and, or, =, not=, <, >, <=, >=, in, like, not, between

Where can also take a map at any point and will create a clause that compares keys
to values. The value can be a vector with one of the above predicate functions
describing how the key is related to the value:
  (where query {:name [like "chris"]})

====
where*

(where* query clause)

Add a where clause to the query. Clause can be either a map or a string, and
will be AND'ed to the other clauses.

====
with

macro
(with query ent & body)

Add a related entity to the given select query. 

If the entity has a relationship
type of :belongs-to or :has-one, the requested fields will be returned directly in
the result map. 

If the entity is a :has-many, a second query will be executed lazily
and a key of the entity name will be assoc'd with a vector of the results.

(defentity email (entity-fields :email))
(defentity user (has-many email))

(select user
  (with email) => [{:name "chris" :email [{email: "c@c.com"}]} ...

With can also take a body that will further refine the relation:

(select user
   (with address
      (with state)
      (fields :address.city :state.state)
      (where {:address.zip x})))

====
with-batch

macro
(with-batch query ent & body)

Add a related entity. This behaves like `with`, except that, 

for has-many
relationships, it runs a single query to get relations of all fetched rows.
This is faster than regular `with` but it doesn't support many of the
additional options (order, limit, offset, group, having)

和 with 类似，但它用单条语句获取所有关联数据。
它更快，但不支持排序，分页，分组聚集。
