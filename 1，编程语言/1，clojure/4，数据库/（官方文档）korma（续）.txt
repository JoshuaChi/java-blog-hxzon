update queries
更新语句

(update users
  (set-fields {:status "active"
               :beta false})
  (where {:visits [> 10]}))

==
;; You can also compose updates over time:
(def base (-> (update* users)
              (set-fields {:status "active"})))

(-> base
    (set-fields {:beta false})
    (where {:visits [> 10]})
    (update))
;; Does the same thing 

Update queries use the (set-fields) function to specifiy the fields to be updated. 
Multiple calls to set-fields will be merged together, allowing you to build the update over time. 
Updates also allow where clauses as you would expect.

可以有多个 (set-fields) 子句，它们会被合并。

========
insert queries
插入语句

;; You can insert a single value:
(insert users
  (values {:first "john" :last "doe"}))

;; or a collection of several:
(insert users
  (values [{:first "john" :last "doe"}
           {:first "jane" :last "doe"}]))

==
;; You can also compose inserts:
;; 可以组合插入语句
(def base (-> (insert* users)
            (values {:first "john" :last "doe"})))

(-> base
  (values {:first "jane" :last "doe"})
  (insert))
;; Same thing as the collection insert


Insert queries use the function (values) to add records. 
It takes either a single map or a collection of maps and returns the id of the first inserted record.

用单个映射，或映射的集合来表示要插入的记录。
然后返回插入的第一条记录的 id 。

========
delete queries
删除语句

(delete users
  (where {:visits [< 3]})) 

==
;;You can also compose deletes:
(def base (-> (delete* users)
            (where {:visits [< 3]})))

(-> base
  (where {:status [not= "active"]})
  (delete))

Delete queries only allow where clauses 
and not including one will cause all records for the given entity to be deleted. 
The result of a delete is the id of the first record deleted.

返回第一条被删除的记录的 id 。

========
misc
杂项

;; you can get a string of the SQL instead of executing
;; by using the sql-only mode
;; 获得生成的 sql 语句（字符串）

(sql-only
  (select users))

;; => "SELECT * FROM users"

;; You can print a string of the sql, with the params and
;; return fake results by using the dry-run mode
;; 可以打印一条带参数的 sql 语句，并返回伪造的查询结果

(dry-run
  (select users
    (where {:age [> 5]})))

;; dry run :: SELECT * FROM users WHERE (user.age > ?) :: [5]
;; => [{:id 1}]


By default, when exec is called, it simply generates the SQL string and params necessary for your query 
and sends those to your database. 
Sometimes, however, what you really want is to just generate the string, 
or even do a dry run where you see the SQL printed to the console. 
As such, korma includes a couple of other execution modes that allow you to do exactly that. 
These also apply to queries that are composed over time and then executed using the (exec) function.

====
;;transaction, rollback, and is-rollback? are in korma.db
;; 开启事务，事务回滚，检查事务是否回滚

(transaction
  (insert users
    (values {:first "cool"}))
  (insert address
    (values {:address1 "cool"})))

(transaction    ;; 开启事务
  (if-not (valid?)
    (rollback)    ;; 回滚
    (do-complicated-query))
  (when-not (is-rollback?)    ;; 检查是否回滚
    (println "success!")))

You can do transactions in Korma simply by using the (transaction) macro, 
which ensures that all queries executed within it are part of a single transaction. 
You can then use the (rollback) function to force the transaction to rollback if necessary.

====
(select users
  (fields :id :first (raw "users.last"))    ;; 使用 raw 直接插入字符串
  (where {:first [like "%_test5"]}))

;;Or when all else fails, you can simply use exec raw
(exec-raw ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > ?" [5]] :results) 

You may find yourself in need of functionality that Korma doesn't have. 
Luckily, there are a couple of facilities that help you here: 
(raw) which injects a string into a query 
and (exec-raw) which allows you to write a parameterized query directly.

(raw) 允许你插入一个字符串到查询中，
(exec-raw) 允许你直接执行一个参数化的语句（字符串）。
