（hxzon学习笔记）clojure-类型定义形式

====
compile
function
Usage: (compile lib)
Compiles the namespace named by the symbol lib into a set of
classfiles. The source for the lib must be in a proper
classpath-relative directory. The output files will go into the
directory specified by *compile-path*, and that directory too must
be in the classpath.
Added in Clojure version 1.0

====
*compile-files*
var
Set to true when compiling files, false otherwise.
Added in Clojure version 1.0

====
*compile-path*
var
Specifies the directory where 'compile' will write out .class
files. This directory must be in the classpath for 'compile' to
work.

Defaults to "classes"
Added in Clojure version 1.0

====
*compiler-options*
var
A map of keys to options.
Note, when binding dynamically make sure to merge with previous value.

Supported options:

:elide-meta - a collection of metadata keys to elide during compilation.
指定哪些元数据要移除。

:disable-locals-clearing - set to true to disable clearing, useful for using a debugger
Alpha, subject to change.

Added in Clojure version 1.4

========
gen-class

macro
Usage: (gen-class & options)

When compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
given package-qualified :name (which, as all names in these
parameters, can be a string or symbol), and writes the .class file
to the *compile-path* directory.  

When not compiling, does nothing. 

The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the
implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in
functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated
class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class
will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by 
(str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: "-") in a
Clojure namespace specified by :impl-ns
(defaults to the current namespace).

All inherited methods,
generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init,
and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. 

By default, the
static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the
Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath,
e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``. This
behavior can be controlled by :load-impl-ns

Note that methods with a maximum of 18 parameters are supported.

In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be
referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the
java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier. All other
classes must be fully qualified.
除了java原始类型，和java.lang中的类型，其它类必须使用全名。

Options should be a set of key/value pairs, all except for :name are optional:

:name aname
要生成的类名。
The package-qualified name of the class to be generated

:extends aclass
父类。
Specifies the superclass, the non-private methods of which will be
overridden by the class. If not provided, defaults to Object.

:implements [interface ...]
实现的接口。
One or more interfaces, the methods of which will be implemented by the class.

:init name
构造函数。
If supplied, names a function that will be called with the arguments
to the constructor. Must return [ [superclass-constructor-args] state] 
If not supplied, the constructor args are passed directly to
the superclass constructor and the state will be nil
必须返回一个向量。

:constructors {[param-types] [super-param-types], ...}
本类构造函数参数，到“父类构造函数参数”的映射。
By default, constructors are created for the generated class which
match the signature(s) of the constructors for the superclass. This
parameter may be used to explicitly specify constructors, each entry
providing a mapping from a constructor signature to a superclass
constructor signature. When you supply this, you must supply an :init
specifier. 

:post-init name
每当实例被创建时调用，在所有的继承而来的构造函数被调用之后。
If supplied, names a function that will be called with the object as
the first argument, followed by the arguments to the constructor.
It will be called every time an object of this class is created,
immediately after all the inherited constructors have completed.
It's return value is ignored.

:methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...]
新增的方法。
The generated class automatically defines all of the non-private
methods of its superclasses/interfaces. This parameter can be used
to specify the signatures of additional methods of the generated
class. Static methods can be specified with ^{:static true} in the
signature's metadata. Do not repeat superclass/interface signatures
here.
可以使用^state标记为静态方法。

:main boolean
是否生成main方法。
If supplied and true, a static public main function will be generated. It will
pass each string of the String[] argument as a separate argument to
a function called (str prefix main).

:factory name
工厂函数。
If supplied, a (set of) public static factory function(s) will be
created with the given name, and the same signature(s) as the
constructor(s).

:state name
实例的状态。
If supplied, a public final instance field with the given name will be
created. You must supply an :init function in order to provide a
value for the state. Note that, though final, the state can be a ref
or agent, supporting the creation of Java objects with transactional
or asynchronous mutation semantics.

:exposes {protected-field-name {:get name :set name}, ...}
导出父类的受保护的字段，以便“实现函数”能够访问。
Since the implementations of the methods of the generated class
occur in Clojure functions, they have no access to the inherited
protected fields of the superclass. This parameter can be used to
generate public getter/setter methods exposing the protected field(s)
for use in the implementation.

:exposes-methods {super-method-name exposed-name, ...}
导出父类的方法。
It is sometimes necessary to call the superclass' implementation of an
overridden method.  Those methods may be exposed and referred in 
the new method implementation by a local name.

:prefix string
实现函数的前缀。
Default: "-" Methods called e.g. Foo will be looked up in vars called
prefixFoo in the implementing ns.

:impl-ns name
实现函数所在的命名空间。
Default: the name of the current ns. Implementations of methods will be 
looked up in this namespace.

:load-impl-ns boolean
是否加载实现函数所在的命名空间。
Default: true. Causes the static initializer for the generated class
to reference the load code for the implementing namespace. Should be
true when implementing-ns is the default, false if you intend to
load the code via some other method.

Added in Clojure version 1.0

========
deftype

macro
Usage: (deftype name [& fields] & opts+specs)
(deftype name [fields*]  options* specs*)

Currently there are no options.

Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero
or more method bodies:

protocol-or-interface-or-Object
(methodName [args*] body)*

Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given
name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the
given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or
interfaces. 

The class will have the (by default, immutable) fields named by
fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods
are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those
declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are
not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields,
and those fields can be accessed directy. Fields can be qualified
with the metadata :volatile-mutable true or :unsynchronized-mutable
true, at which point (set! afield aval) will be supported in method
bodies. Note well that mutable fields are extremely difficult to use
correctly, and are present only to facilitate the building of higher
level constructs, such as Clojure's reference types, in Clojure
itself. They are for experts only - if the semantics and
implications of :volatile-mutable or :unsynchronized-mutable are not
immediately apparent to you, you should not be using them.

Method definitions take the form:

(methodname [args*] body)

The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and
methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type
hints should be reserved for disambiguation.

Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired
protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for
methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to
correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus
methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method
head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
automatically and can not be substituted.

In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the
class (for calls to new, instance? etc).

When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and
writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.

One constructor will be defined, taking the designated fields.  Note
that the field names __meta and __extmap are currently reserved and
should not be used when defining your own types.

Given (deftype TypeName ...), a factory function called ->TypeName
will be defined, taking positional parameters for the fields
Added in Clojure version 1.2

========
defrecord

macro
Usage: (defrecord name [& fields] & opts+specs)
(defrecord name [fields*]  options* specs*)

Currently there are no options.

Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero
or more method bodies:

protocol-or-interface-or-Object
(methodName [args*] body)*

Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given
name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the
given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or
interfaces.

The class will have the (immutable) fields named by
fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods
are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those
declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are
not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields,
and those fields can be accessed directly.

methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method
head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
automatically and can not be substituted.

In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the
class (for calls to new, instance? etc).

The class will have implementations of several (clojure.lang)
interfaces generated automatically: IObj (metadata support) and
IPersistentMap, and all of their superinterfaces.

In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based =,
and will defined Java .hashCode and .equals consistent with the
contract for java.util.Map.

When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the
given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and
writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.

Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields
followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field
map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for
meta and extension fields). Note that the field names __meta
and __extmap are currently reserved and should not be used when
defining your own records.

Given (defrecord TypeName ...), two factory functions will be
defined: ->TypeName, taking positional parameters for the fields,
and map->TypeName, taking a map of keywords to field values.

========
reify
内联实现。匿名类型。

macro
Usage: (reify & opts+specs)
reify is a macro with the following structure:

(reify options* specs*)

Currently there are no options.

Each spec consists of the protocol or interface name followed by zero
or more method bodies:

protocol-or-interface-or-Object
(methodName [args+] body)*

Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired
protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for
必须实现协议或接口的所有方法。
methods of Object. Note that the first parameter must be supplied to
可以覆盖Object的方法。
correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus
methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the
interface declarations.  Note also that recur calls to the method
head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied
automatically and can not be substituted.

The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name,
and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you
leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity
method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. 

If you supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or
default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return
type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple
independent method definitions must be supplied.  If overloaded with
same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to
disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object.

recur works to method heads The method bodies of reify are lexical
closures, and can refer to the surrounding local scope:
 
(str (let [f "foo"] 
     (reify Object 
       (toString [this] f))))
== "foo"

(seq (let [f "foo"] 
     (reify clojure.lang.Seqable 
       (seq [this] (seq f)))))
== (\f \o \o))

reify always implements clojure.lang.IObj and transfers meta
data of the form to the created object.
 
(meta ^{:k :v} (reify Object (toString [this] "foo")))
== {:k :v}

========
proxy
代理。匿名类型。

macro
Usage: (proxy class-and-interfaces args & fs)
class-and-interfaces - a vector of class names

args - a (possibly empty) vector of arguments to the superclass
constructor.
父类构造函数的参数。

f => (name [params*] body) or
(name ([params*] body) ([params+] body) ...)

Expands to code which creates a instance of a proxy class that
implements the named class/interface(s) by calling the supplied
fns. A single class, if provided, must be first. If not provided it
defaults to Object.

The interfaces names must be valid interface types. If a method fn
is not provided for a class method, the superclass methd will be
called. If a method fn is not provided for an interface method, an
UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown should it be
called. 

Method fns are closures and can capture the environment in
which proxy is called. 

Each method fn takes an additional implicit
first arg, which is bound to 'this. 

Note that while method fns can
be provided to override protected methods, they have no other access
to protected members, nor to super, as these capabilities cannot be
proxied.
