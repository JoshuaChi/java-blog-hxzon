Hiccup is a library for representing HTML in Clojure. 
It uses vectors to represent elements, and maps to represent an element's attributes.
用向量表示html标签，用映射表示标签的属性。

Add the following dependency to your project.clj file:
[hiccup "1.0.5"]

Syntax

Here is a basic example of Hiccup syntax:

user=> (use 'hiccup.core)
nil
user=> (html [:span {:class "foo"} "bar"])
"<span class=\"foo\">bar</span>"

The first element of the vector is used as the element name. 
The second attribute can optionally be a map, in which case it is used to supply the element's attributes. 
Every other element is considered part of the tag's body.
首元素是标签名。
第二部分是可选的映射，表示属性。
其余部分是标签的身体。

==
Hiccup is intelligent enough to render different HTML elements in different ways, 
in order to accommodate browser quirks:

user=> (html [:script])
"<script></script>"
user=> (html [:p])
"<p />"

==
And provides a CSS-like shortcut for denoting id and class attributes:
简写方式：

user=> (html [:div#foo.bar.baz "bang"])
"<div id=\"foo\" class=\"bar baz\">bang</div>"

If the body of the element is a seq, its contents will be expanded out into the element body. 
This makes working with forms like map and for more convenient:
用序列来表示标签的身体。

user=> (html [:ul
               (for [x (range 1 4)]
                 [:li x])])
"<ul><li>1</li><li>2</li><li>3</li></ul>"
