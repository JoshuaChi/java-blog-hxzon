This section describes the communication between the server and the clients. 
The request sent from the client to the server is called the AU requests, 
while the response from the server to the client is called the AU responses. 
For browsers, they are actually based on Ajax. Communication.png

AU Requests

An AU request is a request sent from the client to the server to notify an event happening at the client, 
such as a click, a state change and so on[1].
↑ For browsers, an AU request is an Ajax request.

Client-side Firing
客户端触发事件

1 Fire Event to Widget
2 Fire Event to Desktop
3 Fire Event Directly to Server
4 What States to Send Back the Server
5 Version History

In general, an AU request is caused by a widget event (Event) that is going to be sent to the server. 
This happens when the widget event targets a widget that is created at the server, 
or with the toServer option (specified in Event.opts). 
In addition, you could invoke Au.fire() explicitly to fire an AU request to the server.

====
Fire Event to Widget
触发事件
An event can be fired to a widget by the use of Widget.fire(String, Object, Map, int) and Widget.fireX(Event, int). 
For example,

onCloseClick: function () {
 this.fire('onClose');
}

The event will be propagated to the widget's parent, parent's parent and so on, until all ancestors are notified, 
or the propagation has been stopped by Event.stop(Map).
事件会不断向上传播。

After the widget and all of its ancestors are notified, this event is converted to an AU request and sent to the server, if
当部件，及部件所有的祖先被通知后，事件转为au请求，如果部件有对应的组件。
The widget has a peer component, i.e., the widget was created by ZK Client Engine because of the instantiation of a component at the server[1]. 
↑ If a widget is created automatically because of a peer component, Widget.inServer will be true.


Notice that, to minimize the traffic, ZK Client Engine sends the AU request only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
注意，只有以下情况事件会发起au请求：
The event is declared as an important event (at server).
The server has registered an event listener (EventListener) for it.
Or, the toServer option has been specified in Event.opts of the event. 
For example,

zAu.send(new zk.Event(wgt, "onFoo", {foo: 'my data'}, {toServer:true}));

For more information, please refer to the next section.

====
Fire Event to Desktop

At the client, a desktop (Desktop) is also a widget (Widget). 
So, firing an event to a desktop is the same as firing to a widget.

If you would like to fire an event to all desktops, please refer to the next section.

====
Fire Event Directly to Server
直达服务端的事件

If you would like to fire an event to the server directly, you could invoke zAu.send(Event, int). 
In other words, the event won't go through the target widget's listeners, and will be sent to the server, 
no matter if it has a peer component or anything else.
不会通过部件的监听器，而是直接发到服务端。

The second argument specifies the time to wait before sending the request (unit: milliseconds). 
If negative, the event won't be sent until anther event with non-negative delay is about to be sent. 
In other words, if negative, it means the event is deferrable.

If you would like to send an event to all desktops (in the current browser window), 
you could specify null as the target widget of the event.

====
What States to Send Back the Server
哪些数据需要回传给服务端

A component has to synchronize every state affecting the widget's behavior to the client, 
but the widget is required to send to the server only the state that is changed by the user. 
For better performance and offline capability, it is not necessary to send back the states changed by the client application.
For example, the change of the value of a textbox widget is better to send back to the peer widget since the user might change it. 
On the other hand, it is not necessary to send the change of the value of a label widget, since the user won't be able to change it.

====
Process AU Requests at Server

ClientEventAuRequest.png

A widget event (Event) is converted to an AU request and then sent to the server. 
When the event arrives at the server, it is converted to be an instance of AuRequest), 
and then pass to the desktop for serving by invoking DesktopCtrl.service(AuRequest, boolean). 
If the request is targeting a component, the component's ComponentCtrl.service(AuRequest, boolean) will then be called to serve it.
传给以上两个方法处理。

==
Component State Synchronization

Thus, if you implement a component, you could override ComponentCtrl.service(AuRequest, boolean) to handle it.
Here is an example (from Radio):

public void service(org.zkoss.zk.au.AuRequest request, boolean everError) {
    final String cmd = request.getCommand();
    if (cmd.equals(Events.ON_CHECK)) {
        CheckEvent evt = CheckEvent.getCheckEvent(request);
        _checked = evt.isChecked();
        fixSiblings(_checked, true);
        Events.postEvent(evt);
    } else
        super.service(request, everError);
}

====
Application-level Notification
应用程序级的通知

If the AU request is sent by an application for custom service, you could implement AuService to serve it 
and then plug it to the targeted component or desktop, depending on your requirement. 
定制请求的处理。
If the request is targeting a desktop, you can only intercept it at the desktop-level. 
If targeting a component, you could intercept it at either component-level or desktop-level.

Since all requests will be passed through AuService that you plug, 
the performance of the implementation should be good. 
In addition, this method should return true if it has been processed to avoid any further processing.
所有的请求都会被处理。

public class FooAuService implements AuService {
    public boolean service(AuRequest request, boolean everError) {
        final String cmd = request.getCommand();
        if ("onFoo".equals(cmd)) { //assume onFoo a custom request
            //handle it
            return true; //indicate it has been processed
        }
        return false; //not processed at all
    }
}

==
Intercept at Desktop-level

To plug it to the desktop, you could implement a listener of DesktopInit to add it to a desktop by Desktop.addListener(Object). 
Then, specify the listener to WEB-INF/zk.xml. 
For example,

package foo;
public class FooDesktopInit implements DesktopInit {
    public void init(Desktop desktop,  Object request) throws Exception {
        desktop.addListener(new FooAuService()); //assume you have a custom service called FooAuService
    }
}

and, in WEB-INF/zk.xml

<listener>
    <listener-class>foo.FooDesktopInit</listener-class>
</listener>

==
Intercept at Component-level

To plug it to the component, you could invoke Component.setAuService(AuService).

====
Client Event Declaration
声明服务端监听哪些客户端事件

As described in the previous section, a widget event (Event) will be sent to the server, only if the server needs it.
To declare an event that a server might need it, you have to invoke AbstractComponent.addClientEvent(Class, String, int). 
It is a static method and usually called in a static clause as shown below.

public class A extends LabelImageElement {
    static {
        addClientEvent(A.class, Events.ON_FOCUS, 0);
        addClientEvent(A.class, Events.ON_BLUR, 0);
    }
//...
}

Once declared, an event will be sent to the server if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
以下两种情况，事件会回传给服务端：
An event listener (EventListener) has been registered at the server.
注册了事件监听器。
The event has been declared as important (see below).
标记为“重要事件”。

==
Important Events
“重要事件”

Some events that must be sent to the server no matter if an event listener has been registered for it. 
有些事件，即使没有注册事件监听器，也必须回传给服务端。
Typical examples are events that are used to synchronize the states back to the server, such as onChange.
These events are called important events. 
You could declare an event as important by specifying ComponentCtrl.CE_IMPORTANT as follows.

static {
    addClientEvent(InputElement.class, Events.ON_CHANGE, CE_IMPORTANT|CE_REPEAT_IGNORE);
}

Notice that the important event won't be sent to the server immediately 
if it does not have any non-deferrable event listener at the server[1].

↑ A deferrable event listener is an event listener that also implements Deferrable. 
Please refer to ZK Developer's Reference: Event Listening for details.

==
Force Event to Send Back
强制回传事件

AbstractComponent.addClientEvent(Class, String, int) is usually used by a component developer 
since the first argument must be the component's class. 
For application developers, it is more straightforward by specifying the toServer option in Event.opts when instantiating an event. 
For example,

zAu.send(new zk.Event(wgt, "onFoo", {foo: 'my data'}, {toServer:true}));

========
JSON

The data of a widget event (Event.data) is serialized to a string (so-called marshal) by JSON, 
when the event is sent back to the server. 
ZK Update Engine will unmarshal it back to a map. 
If an entry of the data is an array, it will be converted to a list[1].

The map of data can be retrieve by the use of AuRequest.getData().
For example, assume we fire an event at the client as follows.

wgt.fire('onFly', {x: 10, y: 20});

Then, we can retrieve and process it at the server as follows:

public class Fly extends AbstractComponet {
  static {
    addClientEvent(Fly.class, "onFly", CE_IMPORTANT); //assume it is an important event
  }
 
  public void service(org.zkoss.zk.au.AuRequest request, boolean everError) {
    String cmd = request.getCommand();
    if (cmd.equals("onFly")) {
      Map data = request.getData();
      int x = ((Integer)data.get("x")).intValue();
      int y = ((Integer)data.get("y")).intValue();
      //do whatever you want
    } else {
      super.service(request, everError);
    }
  }
}

Notice that
AuRequests provides a collection of utilities to convert it to int, long and boolean.
An integer number is converted to an instance of Integer if it is not overflow (i.e., less than Integer.MAX_VALUE). 
Otherwise, Long is assumed.
A decimal number (with . or e) is converted to an instance of Double.

If the data is not a map, it can be retrieved with the empty key:

Types in JavaScript	 
Codes in Java

wgt.fire("onFly", "sky");	 
String sky = (String)request.getData().get("");

wgt.fire("onFly", 123);	 
Integer val = (Integer)request.getData().get("");

wgt.fire("onFly", ["sky", 123]);	 
List data = (List)request.getData().get("");
String sky = (String)data.get(0); 
Integer val = (Integer)data.get(1);

wgt.fire("onFly", {left:'10px', top:20px', more:[1, 2]});	 
Map data = request.getData();
String left = (String)data.get("left"); 
String top = (String)data.get("top"); 
List more = (List)data.get("more"); 
Integer v1 = (Integer)more.get(0);


Map data = request.getData();
String left = (String)data.get("left");
String top = (String)data.get("left");

For custom data types, you can implement toJSON (at the client) to convert a JavaScript object to a string in custom way.

MyClass.prototype.toJSON = function (key) { //key usually meaningless
   return this.uuid;
};

In addition to the default handling, 
You can add a custom AU request service to a component by calling Component.setAuService(AuService).

↑ More precisely, they are converted to JSONObject (a map) and JSONObject (a list)

========
AU Responses

An AU response is the command sent from the server to the client 
for synchronizing back the server's states and performing some functionality. 
In response to the AU request sent by the client, the server could send one or multiple AU responses to the client. 
可发送多个au响应。
Each AU response consists of a command and a sequence of data. 
The command is a string, and the data could be any objects (as long as JSON can handle it).
每个au响应含有一个指令，和一系列数据。

There are two groups of commands depending on whether the command is applied to a particular widget (Widget), 
or to the whole browser. 
For the sake of description, we call the first kind of commands as the widget commands, 
while the second kind the global commands.
有两种指令，部件级指令，全局指令（整个浏览器）。


Class	 
Object	 
Description

AuCmd0	
zAu.cmd0	
AuCmd0 is the class to handle all global commands (i.e., applied to the whole browser).
Furthermore, all global commands are handled by an instance of AuCmd0 called zAu.cmd0.

AuCmd1	
zAu.cmd1	
AuCmd1 is the class to handle all widget commands (i.e., applied to a particular widget).
Furthermore, all global commands are handled by an instance of AuCmd1 called zAu.cmd1.

Add a New Command
添加新指令
If you'd like to add a new command, you could simply add a new property to to zAu.cmd0 or zAu.cmd1, 
depending on your requirement. For example,

zk.zAu.cmd0.bookmark = function (bk, replace) {
    //...
};
