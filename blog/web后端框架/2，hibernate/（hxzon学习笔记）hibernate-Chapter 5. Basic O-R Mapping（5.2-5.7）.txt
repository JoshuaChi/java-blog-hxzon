5.2. Hibernate types

5.2.1. Entities and values

In relation to the persistence service, Java language-level objects are classified into two groups:

An entity exists independently of any other objects holding references to the entity. 
Contrast this with the usual Java model, where an unreferenced object is garbage collected. 
Entities must be explicitly saved and deleted. 
Saves and deletions, however, can be cascaded from a parent entity to its children. 
This is different from the ODMG model of object persistence by reachability 
and corresponds more closely to how application objects are usually used in large systems. 
Entities support circular and shared references. 
They can also be versioned.

An entity's persistent state consists of references to other entities and instances of value types. 
Values are primitives: collections (not what is inside a collection), components and certain immutable objects. 
Unlike entities, values in particular collections and components, are persisted and deleted by reachability. 
Since value objects and primitives are persisted and deleted along with their containing entity, 
they cannot be independently versioned. 
Values have no independent identity, so they cannot be shared by two entities or collections.

Until now, we have been using the term "persistent class" to refer to entities. 
We will continue to do that. 
Not all user-defined classes with a persistent state, however, are entities. 
A component is a user-defined class with value semantics. 
A Java property of type java.lang.String also has value semantics. 
Given this definition, all types (classes) provided by the JDK have value type semantics in Java, 
while user-defined types can be mapped with entity or value type semantics. 
This decision is up to the application developer. 
An entity class in a domain model will normally have shared references to a single instance of that class, 
while composition or aggregation usually translates to a value type.

We will revisit both concepts throughout this reference guide.

The challenge is to map the Java type system, 
and the developers' definition of entities and value types, to the SQL/database type system. 
The bridge between both systems is provided by Hibernate. 
For entities, <class>, <subclass> and so on are used. 
For value types we use <property>, <component>etc., that usually have a type attribute. 
The value of this attribute is the name of a Hibernate mapping type. 
Hibernate provides a range of mappings for standard JDK value types out of the box. 
You can write your own mapping types and implement your own custom conversion strategies.

With the exception of collections, all built-in Hibernate types support null semantics.
除了集合类型，所有hibernate内建的类型都支持null语义。

====
5.2.2. Basic value types

The built-in basic mapping types can be roughly categorized into the following:

integer, long, short, float, double, character, byte, boolean, yes_no, true_false
Type mappings from Java primitives or wrapper classes to appropriate (vendor-specific) SQL column types. 
boolean, yes_no and true_false are all alternative encodings for a Java boolean or java.lang.Boolean.

string
A type mapping from java.lang.String to VARCHAR (or Oracle VARCHAR2).

date, time, timestamp
Type mappings from java.util.Date and its subclasses to SQL types DATE, TIME and TIMESTAMP (or equivalent).

calendar, calendar_date
Type mappings from java.util.Calendar to SQL types TIMESTAMP and DATE (or equivalent).

big_decimal, big_integer
Type mappings from java.math.BigDecimal and java.math.BigInteger to NUMERIC (or Oracle NUMBER).

locale, timezone, currency
Type mappings from java.util.Locale, java.util.TimeZone and java.util.Currency to VARCHAR (or Oracle VARCHAR2). 
Instances of Locale and Currency are mapped to their ISO codes. Instances of TimeZone are mapped to their ID.

class
A type mapping from java.lang.Class to VARCHAR (or Oracle VARCHAR2). A Class is mapped to its fully qualified name.

binary
Maps byte arrays to an appropriate SQL binary type.

text
Maps long Java strings to a SQL LONGVARCHAR or TEXT type.

image
Maps long byte arrays to a SQL LONGVARBINARY.

serializable
Maps serializable Java types to an appropriate SQL binary type. 
You can also indicate the Hibernate type serializable with the name of a serializable Java class or interface that does not default to a basic type.

clob, blob
Type mappings for the JDBC classes java.sql.Clob and java.sql.Blob. 
These types can be inconvenient for some applications, since the blob or clob object cannot be reused outside of a transaction. 
Driver support is patchy and inconsistent.

materialized_clob
Maps long Java strings to a SQL CLOB type. When read, the CLOB value is immediately materialized into a Java string. 
Some drivers require the CLOB value to be read within a transaction. Once materialized, the Java string is available outside of the transaction.

materialized_blob
Maps long Java byte arrays to a SQL BLOB type. When read, the BLOB value is immediately materialized into a byte array. 
Some drivers require the BLOB value to be read within a transaction. Once materialized, the byte array is available outside of the transaction.

imm_date, imm_time, imm_timestamp, imm_calendar, imm_calendar_date, imm_serializable, imm_binary
Type mappings for what are considered mutable Java types. 
This is where Hibernate makes certain optimizations appropriate only for immutable Java types, 
and the application treats the object as immutable. 
For example, you should not call Date.setTime() for an instance mapped as imm_timestamp. 
To change the value of the property, and have that change made persistent, the application must assign a new, nonidentical, object to the property.

Unique identifiers of entities and collections can be of any basic type except binary, blob and clob. 
Composite identifiers are also allowed. See below for more information.

The basic value types have corresponding Type constants defined on org.hibernate.Hibernate. 
For example, Hibernate.STRING represents the string type.

====
5.2.3. Custom value types

It is relatively easy for developers to create their own value types. 
For example, you might want to persist properties of type java.lang.BigInteger to VARCHAR columns. 
Hibernate does not provide a built-in type for this. Custom types are not limited to mapping a property, or collection element, to a single table column. So, for example, you might have a Java property getName()/setName() of type java.lang.String that is persisted to the columns FIRST_NAME, INITIAL, SURNAME.

To implement a custom type, implement either org.hibernate.UserType or org.hibernate.CompositeUserType 
and declare properties using the fully qualified classname of the type. 
View org.hibernate.test.DoubleStringType to see the kind of things that are possible.

<property name="twoStrings" type="org.hibernate.test.DoubleStringType">
    <column name="first_string"/>
    <column name="second_string"/>
</property>

Notice the use of <column> tags to map a property to multiple columns.

The CompositeUserType, EnhancedUserType, UserCollectionType, 
and UserVersionType interfaces provide support for more specialized uses.

You can even supply parameters to a UserType in the mapping file. 
To do this, your UserType must implement the org.hibernate.usertype.ParameterizedType interface. 
To supply parameters to your custom type, you can use the <type> element in your mapping files.

<property name="priority">
    <type name="com.mycompany.usertypes.DefaultValueIntegerType">
        <param name="default">0</param>
    </type>
</property>
The UserType can now retrieve the value for the parameter named default from the Properties object passed to it.

If you regularly use a certain UserType, it is useful to define a shorter name for it. 
You can do this using the <typedef> element. 
Typedefs assign a name to a custom type, and can also contain a list of default parameter values if the type is parameterized.

<typedef class="com.mycompany.usertypes.DefaultValueIntegerType" name="default_zero">
    <param name="default">0</param>
</typedef>
<property name="priority" type="default_zero"/>

It is also possible to override the parameters supplied in a typedef on a case-by-case basis by using type parameters on the property mapping.

Even though Hibernate's rich range of built-in types and support for components means you will rarely need to use a custom type, 
it is considered good practice to use custom types for non-entity classes that occur frequently in your application. 
For example, a MonetaryAmount class is a good candidate for a CompositeUserType, 
even though it could be mapped as a component. 
One reason for this is abstraction. With a custom type, 
your mapping documents would be protected against changes to the way monetary values are represented.

===========
5.3. Mapping a class more than once
将一个类映射到多个表

It is possible to provide more than one mapping for a particular persistent class. 
In this case, you must specify an entity name to disambiguate between instances of the two mapped entities. 
必须使用不同的实体名。（hxzon：相当于多个实体，只是使用了同一个类。）
By default, the entity name is the same as the class name. 
Hibernate lets you specify the entity name when working with persistent objects, 
when writing queries, or when mapping associations to the named entity.

<class name="Contract" table="Contracts"
        entity-name="CurrentContract">
    ...
    <set name="history" inverse="true"
            order-by="effectiveEndDate desc">
        <key column="currentContractId"/>
        <one-to-many entity-name="HistoricalContract"/>
    </set>
</class>

<class name="Contract" table="ContractHistory"
        entity-name="HistoricalContract">
    ...
    <many-to-one name="currentContract"
            column="currentContractId"
            entity-name="CurrentContract"/>
</class>

Associations are now specified using entity-name instead of class.

===========
5.4. SQL quoted identifiers
括起来的标识符

You can force Hibernate to quote an identifier in the generated SQL 
by enclosing the table or column name in backticks in the mapping document. 
Hibernate will use the correct quotation style for the SQL Dialect. 
This is usually double quotes, but the SQL Server uses brackets and MySQL uses backticks.
hibernate会自动转成对应数据库的合适的“括符”。

@Entity @Table(name="`Line Item`")
class LineItem {
   @id @Column(name="`Item Id`") Integer id;
   @Column(name="`Item #`") int itemNumber
}

<class name="LineItem" table="`Line Item`">
    <id name="id" column="`Item Id`"/><generator class="assigned"/></id>
    <property name="itemNumber" column="`Item #`"/>
    ...
</class>

============
5.5. Generated properties
生成的字段值

Generated properties are properties that have their values generated by the database. 
Typically, Hibernate applications needed to refresh objects 
that contain any properties for which the database was generating values. 
Marking properties as generated, however, 
lets the application delegate this responsibility to Hibernate. 
When Hibernate issues an SQL INSERT or UPDATE for an entity that has defined generated properties, 
it immediately issues a select afterwards to retrieve the generated values.

Properties marked as generated must additionally be non-insertable and non-updateable. 
Only versions, timestamps, and simple properties, can be marked as generated.

never (the default): 
the given property value is not generated within the database.

insert: 
the given property value is generated on insert, but is not regenerated on subsequent updates. 
Properties like created-date fall into this category. 
Even though version and timestamp properties can be marked as generated, this option is not available.

always: 
the property value is generated both on insert and on update.

To mark a property as generated, use @Generated.

============
5.7. Auxiliary database objects

Auxiliary database objects allow for the CREATE and DROP of arbitrary database objects. 
In conjunction with Hibernate's schema evolution tools, 
they have the ability to fully define a user schema within the Hibernate mapping files. 
Although designed specifically for creating and dropping things like triggers or stored procedures, 
any SQL command that can be run via a java.sql.Statement.execute() method is valid 
(for example, ALTERs, INSERTS, etc.). 
There are essentially two modes for defining auxiliary database objects:
创建数据库对象。

The first mode is to explicitly list the CREATE and DROP commands in the mapping file:

<hibernate-mapping>
    ...
    <database-object>
        <create>CREATE TRIGGER my_trigger ...</create>
        <drop>DROP TRIGGER my_trigger</drop>
    </database-object>
</hibernate-mapping>

The second mode is to supply a custom class that constructs the CREATE and DROP commands. 
This custom class must implement the org.hibernate.mapping.AuxiliaryDatabaseObject interface.

<hibernate-mapping>
    ...
    <database-object>
        <definition class="MyTriggerDefinition"/>
    </database-object>
</hibernate-mapping>

Additionally, these database objects can be optionally scoped so that they only apply when certain dialects are used.

<hibernate-mapping>
    ...
    <database-object>
        <definition class="MyTriggerDefinition"/>
        <dialect-scope name="org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9iDialect"/>
        <dialect-scope name="org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect"/>
    </database-object>
</hibernate-mapping>
