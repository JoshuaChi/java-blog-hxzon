====

The org.objectweb.asm.commons package contains some predefined method
adapters that can be useful to define your own adapters. This section presents
three of them and shows how they can be used with the AddTimerAdapter
example of section 3.2.4. It also shows how the tools seen in the previous
chapter can be used to ease method generation or transformation.

3.3.1. Basic tools

The tools presented in section 2.3 can also be used for methods.

Type
类型
Many bytecode instructions, such as x LOAD, x ADD or x RETURN, depend on the
type to which they are applied. The Type class provides a getOpcode method
that can be used to get, for these instructions, the opcode corresponding
to a given type. This method takes as parameter an opcode for the int
type, and returns the opcode for the type on which it is called. For instance
t.getOpcode(IMUL) returns FMUL if t is equal to Type.FLOAT_TYPE.

TraceClassVisitor
跟踪查看
This class, which has already been presented in the previous chapter, prints a
textual representation of the classes it visits, including a textual representation
of their methods, in a form very similar to the one used in this chapter. It can
therefore be used to trace the content of generated or transformed methods at
any point in a transformation chain. For example:

java -classpath asm.jar:asm-util.jar \
org.objectweb.asm.util.TraceClassVisitor \
java.lang.Void

prints:
// class version 49.0 (49)
// access flags 49
public final class java/lang/Void {
// access flags 25
// signature Ljava/lang/Class<Ljava/lang/Void;>;
// declaration: java.lang.Class<java.lang.Void>
public final static Ljava/lang/Class; TYPE
// access flags 2
private <init>()V
ALOAD 0
INVOKESPECIAL java/lang/Object.<init> ()V
RETURN
MAXSTACK = 1
MAXLOCALS = 1
// access flags 8
static <clinit>()V
LDC "void"
INVOKESTATIC java/lang/Class.getPrimitiveClass (...)...
PUTSTATIC java/lang/Void.TYPE : Ljava/lang/Class;
RETURN
MAXSTACK = 1
MAXLOCALS = 0
}

This shows how to generate a static block static { ... }, namely with
a <clinit> method (for CLass INITializer). Note that if you want to trace
the content of a single method at some point in a chain, 
instead of tracing all the content of its class, you can use TraceMethodVisitor instead of
TraceClassVisitor (in this case you must specify the backend explicitly; here
we use a Textifier):
只跟踪打印其中一个方法。

public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int access, String name,
	String desc, String signature, String[] exceptions) {
	MethodVisitor mv = cv.visitMethod(access, name, desc, signature, exceptions);

	if (debug && mv != null && ...) { // if this method must be traced
		Printer p = new Textifier(ASM4) {
			@Override public void visitMethodEnd() {
				print(aPrintWriter ); // print it after it has been visited
			}
		};
		mv = new TraceMethodVisitor(mv, p);
	}
	return new MyMethodAdapter (mv);
}

This code prints the method after transformation by MyMethodAdapter.

==
CheckClassAdapter

This class, which has already been presented in the previous chapter, checks
that the ClassVisitor methods are called in the appropriate order, and with
valid arguments, and it does the same for the MethodVisitor methods. It
can therefore be used to check that the MethodVisitor API is correctly used
at any point in a transformation chain. Like with TraceMethodVisitor, you
can use the CheckMethodAdapter class to check a single method instead of
checking all its class:

public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int access, String name,
String desc, String signature, String[] exceptions) {
MethodVisitor mv = cv.visitMethod(access, name, desc, signature,
exceptions);
if (debug && mv != null && ...) { // if this method must be checked
mv = new CheckMethodAdapter(mv);
}
return new MyMethodAdapter (mv);
}

This code checks that MyMethodAdapter uses the MethodVisitor API correctly. 
Note however that this adapter will not check that the bytecode is
correct: for instance it will not detect that ISTORE 1 ALOAD 1 is invalid. In
fact this kind of error can be detected, if you use the other constructor of
CheckMethodAdapter (see the Javadoc), and if you provide valid maxStack
and maxLocals arguments in visitMaxs.

==
ASMifier

This class, which has already been presented in the previous chapter, also
works with the content of methods. It can be used to know how to generate
some compiled code with ASM: just write the corresponding source code in
Java, compile it with javac, and use the ASMifier to visit this class. You
will get the ASM code to generate the bytecode corresponding to your source
code.

====
3.3.2. AnalyzerAdapter

This method adapter computes the stack map frames before each instruction,
based on the frames visited in visitFrame. Indeed, as explained in section
3.1.5, visitFrame is only called before some specific instructions in a method,
in order to save space, and because “the other frames can be easily and quickly
inferred from these ones”. This is what this adapter does. Of course it only
works on classes that contain precomputed stack map frames, i.e. compiled
with Java 6 or higher (or previously upgraded to Java 6 with an ASM adapter
using the COMPUTE_FRAMES option).

In the case of our AddTimerAdapter example, this adapter could be used to
get the size of the operand stack just before the RETURN instructions, thereby
allowing to compute an optimal transformed value for maxStack in visitMaxs
(in fact this method is not recommended in practice, because it is much less
efficient than using COMPUTE_MAXS):

class AddTimerMethodAdapter2 extends AnalyzerAdapter {
private int maxStack;
public AddTimerMethodAdapter2(String owner, int access,
String name, String desc, MethodVisitor mv) {
super(ASM4, owner, access, name, desc, mv);
}
@Override public void visitCode() {
super.visitCode();
mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
mv.visitInsn(LSUB);
mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
maxStack = 4;
}
@Override public void visitInsn(int opcode) {
if ((opcode >= IRETURN && opcode <= RETURN) || opcode == ATHROW) {
mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
mv.visitInsn(LADD);
mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");

maxStack = Math.max(maxStack, stack.size() + 4);
}
super.visitInsn(opcode);
}
@Override public void visitMaxs(int maxStack, int maxLocals) {
super.visitMaxs(Math.max(this.maxStack, maxStack), maxLocals);
}
}

The stack field is defined in the AnalyzerAdapter class, and contains the
types in operand stack. More precisely, in a visitXxx Insn, and before the
overridden method is called, this list contains the state of the operand stack
just before this instruction. Note that the overridden methods must be called
so that the stack field is correctly updated (hence the use of super instead
of mv in the original code).

Alternatively the new instructions can be inserted by calling the methods of
the super class: the effect is that the frames for these instructions will be
computed by AnalyzerAdapter. Since, in addition, this adapter updates the
arguments of visitMaxs based on the frames it computes, we do not need to
update them ourselves:

class AddTimerMethodAdapter3 extends AnalyzerAdapter {
public AddTimerMethodAdapter3(String owner, int access,
String name, String desc, MethodVisitor mv) {
super(ASM4, owner, access, name, desc, mv);
}
@Override public void visitCode() {
super.visitCode();
super.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
super.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
super.visitInsn(LSUB);
super.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
}
@Override public void visitInsn(int opcode) {
if ((opcode >= IRETURN && opcode <= RETURN) || opcode == ATHROW) {
super.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
super.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
super.visitInsn(LADD);
super.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
}
super.visitInsn(opcode);
}
}

==
3.3.3. LocalVariablesSorter

This method adapter renumbers the local variables used in a method in the
order they appear in this method. For instance in a method with two parameters, 
the first local variable read or written whose index is greater than or
equal to 3 – the first three local variables correspond to this and to the two
method parameters, and can therefore not be changed – is assigned index 3,
the second one is assigned index 4, and so on. This adapter is useful to insert
new local variables in a method. Without this adapter it would be necessary
to add new local variables after all the existing ones, but unfortunately their
number is not known until the end of the method, in visitMaxs.
In order to show how this adapter can be used, let’s suppose that we want to
use a local variable to implement AddTimerAdapter:

public class C {
public static long timer;
public void m() throws Exception {
long t = System.currentTimeMillis();
Thread.sleep(100);
timer += System.currentTimeMillis() - t;
}
}

This can be done easily by extending LocalVariablesSorter, and by using
the newLocal method defined in this class:

class AddTimerMethodAdapter4 extends LocalVariablesSorter {
private int time;
public AddTimerMethodAdapter4(int access, String desc,
MethodVisitor mv) {
super(ASM4, access, desc, mv);
}
@Override public void visitCode() {
super.visitCode();
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
time = newLocal(Type.LONG_TYPE);
mv.visitVarInsn(LSTORE, time);
}
@Override public void visitInsn(int opcode) {
if ((opcode >= IRETURN && opcode <= RETURN) || opcode == ATHROW) {
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
mv.visitVarInsn(LLOAD, time);
mv.visitInsn(LSUB);
mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");

mv.visitInsn(LADD);
mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
}
super.visitInsn(opcode);
}
@Override public void visitMaxs(int maxStack, int maxLocals) {
super.visitMaxs(maxStack + 4, maxLocals);
}
}

Note that the original frames associated to the method become invalid when
the local variables are renumbered, and a fortiori when new local variables
are inserted. Hopefully it is possible to avoid recomputing these frames from
scratch: indeed no frames must be added or removed, and it “suffices” 
to reorder the content of local variables in the original frames to get the frames of
the transformed method. LocalVariablesSorter takes care of that automatically. 
If you also need to do incremental stack map frame updates for one of
your method adapters, you can inspire yourself from the source of this class.
As you can see above using a local variable does not solve the problem we
had in the original version of this class, concerning the worst case value for
maxStack. If you want to use an AnalyzerAdapter to solve that, in addition
to a LocalVariablesSorter, you must use these adapters through delegation
instead of via inheritance (since multiple inheritance is not possible):

class AddTimerMethodAdapter5 extends MethodVisitor {
public LocalVariablesSorter lvs;
public AnalyzerAdapter aa;
private int time;
private int maxStack;
public AddTimerMethodAdapter5(MethodVisitor mv) {
super(ASM4, mv);
}
@Override public void visitCode() {
mv.visitCode();
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
time = lvs.newLocal(Type.LONG_TYPE);
mv.visitVarInsn(LSTORE, time);
maxStack = 4;
}
@Override public void visitInsn(int opcode) {
if ((opcode >= IRETURN && opcode <= RETURN) || opcode == ATHROW) {
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System",
"currentTimeMillis", "()J");
mv.visitVarInsn(LLOAD, time);
mv.visitInsn(LSUB);

mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
mv.visitInsn(LADD);
mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
maxStack = Math.max(aa.stack.size() + 4, maxStack);
}
mv.visitInsn(opcode);
}
@Override public void visitMaxs(int maxStack, int maxLocals) {
mv.visitMaxs(Math.max(this.maxStack, maxStack), maxLocals);
}
}

In order to use this adapter you must chain a LocalVariablesSorter to
an AnalyzerAdapter, itself chained to your adapter: the first adapter will
sort local variables and update frames accordingly, the analyzer adapter will
compute intermediate frames taking into account the renumbering done in
the previous adapter, and your adapter will have access to these renumbered
intermediate frames. This chain can be constructed as follows in visitMethod:
mv = cv.visitMethod(access, name, desc, signature, exceptions);
if (!isInterface && mv != null && !name.equals("<init>")) {
AddTimerMethodAdapter5 at = new AddTimerMethodAdapter5(mv);
at.aa = new AnalyzerAdapter(owner, access, name, desc, at);
at.lvs = new LocalVariablesSorter(access, desc, at.aa);
return at.lvs;
}

====
3.3.4. AdviceAdapter

This method adapter is an abstract class that can be used to insert code at
the beginning of a method and just before any RETURN or ATHROW instruction.
Its main advantage is that it also works for constructors, where code must not
be inserted just at the beginning of the constructor, but after the call to the
super constructor. In fact most of the code of this adapter is dedicated to the
detection of this super constructor call.

If you look carefully at the AddTimerAdapter class in section 3.2.4, you will
see that the AddTimerMethodAdapter is not used for constructors, because of
this problem. By inheriting from AdviceAdapter this method adapter can be
improved to work on constructors too (note that AdviceAdapter inherits from
LocalVariablesSorter, so we could also easily use a local variable):

class AddTimerMethodAdapter6 extends AdviceAdapter {

public AddTimerMethodAdapter6(int access, String name, String desc,MethodVisitor mv) {
	super(ASM4, mv, access, name, desc);
}

@Override protected void onMethodEnter() {
	mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
	mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System","currentTimeMillis", "()J");
	mv.visitInsn(LSUB);
	mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
}

@Override protected void onMethodExit(int opcode) {
	mv.visitFieldInsn(GETSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
	mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKESTATIC, "java/lang/System","currentTimeMillis", "()J");
	mv.visitInsn(LADD);
	mv.visitFieldInsn(PUTSTATIC, owner, "timer", "J");
}

@Override public void visitMaxs(int maxStack, int maxLocals) {
	super.visitMaxs(maxStack + 4, maxLocals);
}

}
