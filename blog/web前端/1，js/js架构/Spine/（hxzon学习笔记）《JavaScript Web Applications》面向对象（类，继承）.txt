page6 | Chapter 1: MVC and Classes
===========
Toward Modularity, Creating Classes
面向模块化，创建类

Before we get to the nitty-gritty of MVC, we’re going to cover some preliminary concepts, such as JavaScript classes and events. 
This will give you a solid foundation before
moving on to some of the more advanced concepts.
JavaScript object literals are fine for static classes, but it’s often useful to create classical
classes with inheritance and instances. It’s important to emphasize that JavaScript is a
prototype language, and as such doesn’t include a native class implementation. 
However, support can be emulated fairly easily.

Classes in JavaScript often get a bad rap, criticized for not being part of the “JavaScript
Way,” a term that means essentially nothing. jQuery is effectively neutral when it comes
to structural methodology or inheritance patterns. This can lead JavaScript developers
to  believe  they  shouldn’t  consider  structure—i.e.,  that  classes  aren’t  available  or
shouldn’t be used. In reality, classes are just another tool, and as a pragmatist, I believe
they’re as useful in JavaScript as in any other modern language.

==
Rather than class definitions, JavaScript has constructor functions and the newoperator. 
A constructor function can specify an object’s initial properties and values when it
is instantiated. 
Any JavaScript function can be used as a constructor. 
Use the  newoperator with a constructor function to create a new instance.
任何函数都能作为构造器，只要使用new操作符。
The  newoperator changes a function’s context, as well as the behavior of the return
statement. In practice, using  new and constructors is fairly similar to languages with
native class implementations:
new操作符改变了函数的上下文，也改变了返回语句的行为。

var Person = function(name) {
	this.name = name;
};
// Instantiate Person
var alice = new Person('alice');
// Check instance
assert( alice instanceof Person );


By convention, constructor functions are upper camel-cased to differentiate them from
normal functions. This is important because you don’t ever want to call a constructor
function without the newprefix.
按照约定，作为构造器的函数使用大写开头，以便与普通函数区分。

// Don't do this!
Person('bob'); //=> undefined

The function will just return undefined, and since the context is the window (global)
object, you’ve unintentionally created a global variable, name. Always call constructor
functions using the new keyword.
注意：如果不使用new操作符，则上述函数只返回undefined，上下文是window对象，
你会创建一个全局的name变量。（hxzon：注意）

When a constructor function is called with the new keyword, the context switches from
global (window) to a new and empty context specific to that instance. So, the  this
keyword refers to the current instance. 
Although it might sound complicated, in practice, you can treat it like native class implementations in other languages.
当使用new操作符时，上下文将从window对象切换到一个新的空对象。
此时，this指向了这个新的空对象。

By default, if you don’t return anything from a constructor function, this—the current
context—will be returned. 
Otherwise, you can return any nonprimitive type. 
For example, we could return a function that would set up a new class, the first step in building
our own class emulation library:
如果函数没有返回任何值，则这个新对象会被返回。
你也可以返回任何别的对象，只要不是原始类型。
例如，我们返回一个函数。

var Class = function(){
	var klass = function(){
		this.init.apply(this, arguments);
	};
	klass.prototype.init = function(){};
	return klass;
};

var Person = new Class;
Person.prototype.init = function(){
	// Called on Person instantiation
};
// Usage:
var person = new Person;

Confusingly, due to a JavaScript 2 specification that was never implemented, class is
a reserved keyword. The common convention is instead to name  class variables as
_classor klass.

====
Adding Functions to Classes
给类添加函数

Adding class functions to a constructor function is the same as adding a property onto
any object in JavaScript:
添加类函数，等价于直接在对象身上添加属性。

Person.find = function(id){ /*...*/ };
var person = Person.find(1);

To add instance functions to a constructor function, you need to use the constructor’s
prototype:
添加实例函数，则需要在构造函数的原型对象上添加属性。

Person.prototype.breath = function(){ /*...*/ };
var person = new Person;
person.breath();

A common pattern is to alias a class’ prototype to fn, which is a bit less verbose:
一种常见的实践方案，是为原型对象取个别名fn，便于理解。

Person.fn = Person.prototype;
Person.fn.run = function(){ /*...*/ };

In fact, you’ll see this pattern throughout jQuery plug-ins, which essentially just add
functions to jQuery’s prototype, aliased to jQuery.fn.

====
Adding Methods to Our Class Library

Currently, our class library includes functionality for instantiating and initializing instances. 
Adding properties to classes is the same as adding properties to constructor
functions.
Properties set directly on the class will be equivalent to static members:

var Person = new Class;
// Static functions are added directly on the class
Person.find = function(id){ /* ... */ };
// And now we can call them directly
var person = Person.find(1);

And properties set on the class’ prototype are also available on instances:
var Person = new Class;
// Instance functions are on the prototype
Person.prototype.save = function(){ /* ... */ };
// And now we can call them on instances
var person = new Person;
person.save();

However, in my opinion, that syntax is a little convoluted, impractical, and repetitive.
It’s difficult to see, at a glance, a list of your class’ static and instance properties. Instead,
let’s create a different way of adding properties to our classes using two functions,
extend() and include():
上述方式不够清晰，我们创建两个便捷函数。

var Class = function(){
	var klass = function(){
		this.init.apply(this, arguments);
	};
	klass.prototype.init = function(){};
	// Shortcut to access prototype
	klass.fn = klass.prototype;
	// Shortcut to access class
	klass.fn.parent = klass;
	// Adding class properties
	klass.extend = function(obj){
		var extended = obj.extended;
		for(var i in obj){
			klass[i] = obj[i];
		}
		if (extended) extended(klass);
	};
	// Adding instance properties
	
	klass.include = function(obj){
		var included = obj.included;
		for(var i in obj){
			klass.fn[i] = obj[i];
		}
		if (included) included(klass);
	};
	return klass;
};

In  the improved class library above, we’re adding an  extend()function to generated
classes, which accepts an object. The object’s properties are iterated through and copied
directly onto the class:

var Person = new Class;
Person.extend({
	find: function(id) { /* ... */ },
	exists: functions(id) { /* ... */ }
});
var person = Person.find(1);

The include() function works in exactly the same way, except properties are copied
onto the class’ prototype, rather than directly onto the class. 
In other words, the properties are on the class’ instance, rather than statically on the class.
include()用来添加实例方法。

var Person = new Class;
Person.include({
	save: function(id) { /* ... */ },
	destroy: functions(id) { /* ... */ }
});
var person = new Person;
person.save();

We’re also implementing support for extended and included callbacks. 
If these properties are present on the passed object, they’ll be invoked:

Person.extend({
	extended: function(klass) {
		console.log(klass, " was extended!");
	}
});

If you’ve used classes in Ruby, this should all look very familiar. The beauty of this
approach is that we’ve now got support for modules. Modules are reusable pieces of
code, and they can be used as an alternative to inheritance for sharing common properties among classes.
我们获得了模块的能力。
模块即可复用的代码。

var ORMModule = {
	save: function(){
		// Shared function
	}
};

var Person = new Class;
var Asset = new Class;
Person.include(ORMModule);
Asset.include(ORMModule);

====
Class Inheritance Using Prototype
原型继承

We’ve been using the prototype property a lot, but it hasn’t really been explained yet.
Let’s take a closer look at what it is exactly and how to use it to implement a form of
inheritance in our classes.

JavaScript is a prototype-based language and—rather than make distinctions between
classes and instances—it has the notions of a  prototypical object: an object used as a
template from which to get the initial properties for a new object. Any object can be
associated as a prototype of another object, sharing its properties. In practice, you can
look at this as a form of inheritance.

When you fetch a property on an object, JavaScript will search the local object for the
property. If it isn’t found, JavaScript will start searching the object’s prototype and
continue up the prototype tree, eventually reaching Object.prototype. If the property
is found, its value is returned; otherwise, undefinedwill be returned.
当我们访问一个属性时，现在本对象查找。
如果未找到，则在对象的prototype上找。
如果未找到，则在prototype的prototype上查找，直到Object.prototype。

In other words, if you start adding properties to  Array.prototype, they’ll be reflected
across every JavaScript array.

To subclass a class and inherit its properties, you need to first define a constructor
function. Then, you need to assign a new instance of the parent class as the prototype
for your constructor function. It looks like this:

var Animal = function(){};
Animal.prototype.breath = function(){ 
	console.log('breath'); 
};
var Dog = function(){};
// Dog inherits from Animal
Dog.prototype = new Animal;
Dog.prototype.wag = function(){
	console.log('wag tail');
};

Now, we can check to see whether the inheritance works:

var dog = new Dog;
dog.wag();
dog.breath(); // Inherited property

====
Adding Inheritance to Our Class Library

Let’s  add inheritance to our custom class library. 
We’ll pass through an optional parent
class when creating a new class:

var Class = function(parent){
	var klass = function(){
		this.init.apply(this, arguments);
	};
	// Change klass' prototype 
	if (parent) {
		var subclass = function() { };
		subclass.prototype = parent.prototype;
		klass.prototype = new subclass;
	};
	klass.prototype.init = function(){};
	// Shortcuts
	klass.fn = klass.prototype;
	klass.fn.parent = klass;
	klass._super = klass.__proto__; 
	/* include/extend code... */
	return klass;
};

If a  parentis passed to the  Class constructor, we make sure any subclasses share the
same prototype. This little dance around creating a temporary anonymous function
prevents instances from being created when a class is inherited. The caveat here is that
only instance properties, not class properties, are inherited. 
There isn’t yet a crossbrowser way of setting an object’s  __proto__;. 
Libraries like  Super.js get around this
problem by copying the properties, rather than implementing proper dynamic inheritance.

Now, we can perform simple inheritance by passing parent classes to Class:

var Animal = new Class;
Animal.include({
	breath: function(){ 
		console.log('breath'); 
	}
});

var Cat = new Class(Animal)

// Usage
var tommy = new Cat;
tommy.breath();

====
Function Invocation
函数调用

Like  everything else in JavaScript, functions are just objects. However, unlike other
objects, they can be invoked. The context inside the function—i.e., the value of this—
depends on where and how it’s invoked.
this，依赖于函数在哪里，且如何被调用。

Apart from using brackets, there are two other ways to invoke a function: apply() and
call(). The difference between them has to do with the arguments you want to pass
to the function.

The apply() function takes two parameters: a context and an array of arguments. 
If the context is null, the global context is used. For example:
如果上下文参数为null，则使用全局上下文。

function.apply(this, [1, 2, 3])

The call() function has exactly the same behavior, yet it is used differently. 
The first argument is the context, while each subsequent argument is delegated to the invocation.  
In  other  words,  you  use  multiple  arguments—rather  than  an  array  like  with
apply()—to pass arguments to the function.

function.call(this, 1, 2, 3);

Why would you want to change the context? This is a valid question because other
languages get on fine without allowing explicit context changes. JavaScript uses context
changes to share state, especially during event callbacks. (Personally, I feel this was a
mistake in the design of the language, as it can be confusing for beginners and introduce
bugs. However, it’s too late to change it now, so you need to learn how it works.)

jQuery takes advantage of apply() and call() throughout its API to change context—
for example, when using event handlers or iterating using  each(). This can be confusing
at first, but it’s useful when you understand what’s happening:

$('.clicky').click(function(){
// 'this' refers to the element
$(this).hide();
});
$('p').each(function(){
// 'this' refers to the current iteration
$(this).remove();
});

To access the original context, a common pattern stores the value of  thisin a local
variable. For example:

var clicky = {
wasClicked: function(){
/* ... */

},
addListeners: function(){
var self = this;
$('.clicky').click(function(){
self.wasClicked()
});
}
};
clicky.addListeners();

However, we can use apply to make this much cleaner, wrapping the callback within
another anonymous function, which preserves the original context:

var proxy = function(func, thisObject){
	return(function(){ 
		return func.apply(thisObject, arguments); 
	});
};

var clicky = {
	wasClicked: function(){
		/* ... */
	},
	addListeners: function(){
		var self = this;
		$('.clicky').click(proxy(this.wasClicked, this));
	}
};

So, in the above example, we specify the context to be used inside the click callback;
the context jQuery invokes the function in is ignored. In fact, jQuery’s API includes
something to do just this—you guessed it, jQuery.proxy():

$('.clicky').click($.proxy(function(){ /* ... */ }, this));

There are other useful reasons to use apply() and call(), such as delegating. We can
delegate calls from one function to another, and even alter the passed arguments:
在代理模式中很有用。

var App {
	log: function(){
		if (typeof console == "undefined") return;
		// Turn arguments into a proper array
		var args = jQuery.makeArray(arguments);
		// Insert a new argument
		args.unshift("(App)");
		// Delegate to the console
		console.log.apply(console, args);
	}
};

Above, we’re making an array of arguments and then adding our own. Finally, the call
is  delegated to console.log(). If you’re not familiar with the  arguments variable, it’s set
by the interpreter and contains an array of arguments with which the current scope was
called. It’s not a true array though—for example, it’s not mutable—so we have to
convert it to something usable with jquery.makeArray().

====
Controlling Scope in Our Class Library
控制变量作用域

The proxy function described in the previous section is such a useful pattern that we
should add it to our class library. 
We’ll add a proxy function on both classes and instances, allowing us to keep the class’ scope 
when handing functions off to event handlers and the like:

var Class = function(parent){ 
	var klass = function(){
		this.init.apply(this, arguments);
	};
	klass.prototype.init = function(){};
	klass.fn = klass.prototype;
	// Adding a proxy function
	klass.proxy = function(func){
		var self = this;
		return(function(){ 
			return func.apply(self, arguments); 
		});
	}
	// Add the function on instances too
	klass.fn.proxy = klass.proxy;
	return klass;
};

We can now use the proxy() function to wrap up functions, making sure they’re invoked in the right scope:

var Button = new Class;
Button.include({
	init: function(element){
		this.element = jQuery(element);
		// Proxy the click function
		this.element.click(this.proxy(this.click));//代理
	},
	click: function(){ /* ... */ }
});

If we didn’t wrap the  click()  callback with a proxy, it would be called within the
context of this.element, rather than  Button, causing all sorts of problems. 
如果我们没有使用代理，则上下文是this.element，则不是button。

A new specification of JavaScript—ECMAScript, 5th Edition(ES5)—has also added support for
controlling invocation scope with the bind() function. bind() is called on a function,
making sure the function is called in the context of the specified this value. For example:
js5添加了一个bind()函数，用来设置this。

Button.include({
	init: function(element){
		this.element = jQuery(element);
		// Bind the click function
		this.element.click(this.click.bind(this));
	},
	click: function(){ /* ... */ }
});

This  example  is  equivalent  to  our  proxy() function,  and  it  makes  sure  the  click()
function is called with the correct context. Older browsers don’t support bind() but,
luckily, support can be shimmed easily and implemented manually if needed. A shim
basically implements a compatibility layer on legacy browsers, directly extending the
relevant object’s prototypes, 
allowing you to use features of ES5 today without worrying about older browsers. 
For example, a shim that would support  bind() would look
like this:
可以使用下面的代码来兼容旧浏览器。

if ( !Function.prototype.bind ) {
	Function.prototype.bind = function( obj ) {
		var slice = [].slice,
		args = slice.call(arguments, 1), 
		self = this, 
		nop = function () {}, 
		bound = function () {
			return self.apply( this instanceof nop ? this : ( obj || {} ), 
			args.concat( slice.call(arguments) ) ); 
		};
		nop.prototype = self.prototype;
		bound.prototype = new nop();
		return bound;
	};
}

Function’s  prototype  is  only  overwritten  if  the  feature  doesn’t  already  exist:  newer
browsers will continue to use their native implementations. Shimming is especially
useful for arrays, which have had a bunch of new features added in recent JavaScript
versions. I personally use the  “es5-shim” project because it covers as many of the new
features in ES5 as possible.

====
Adding Private Functions
添加私用函数

So far, any property we’ve added to our classes has been open to the world and can be
changed at any time. Let’s now explore how to add private properties to our classes.
A lot of developers end up prefixing private properties with an underscore (_). Although
these can still be changed, it makes it obvious that they’re part of a private API. I try to
steer clear of this approach because it looks rather ugly.

JavaScript does have support for immutable properties; 
however, this isn’t implemented across the main browsers, so we’ll have to wait before using this method. Instead,
we’ll use JavaScript anonymous functions to create a private scope, which can only be
accessed internally:
通过“匿名立即执行”函数来实现私有变量和私有函数。

var Person = function(){};
(function(){
	var findById = function(){ /* ... */ };
	Person.find = function(id){
		if (typeof id == "integer")
		return findById(id);
	};
})();


We’re wrapping all our class’ properties in an anonymous function, then creating local
variables (findById), which can only be accessed in the current scope. 
The Personvariable is defined in the global scope, so it can be accessed from anywhere.
Never define a variable without using the varoperator, since it always creates a global
variable. If you need to define a global variable, do so in the global scope or as a property
on window:

(function(exports){
	var foo = "bar";
	// Expose variable
	exports.foo = foo;
})(window);
assertEqual(foo, "bar");

====
Class Libraries
其它提供类能力的js库

As with a lot of concepts in this book, it’s good to understand the theory behind classes,
but often in practice, you’ll use a library. jQuery doesn’t include class support natively,
but it can easily be added with a plug-in like HJS. HJS lets you define classes by passing
a set of properties to $.Class.create:

var Person = $.Class.create({
	// constructor
	initialize: function(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
});

To inherit classes, pass their parent as an argument when creating them:

var Student = $.Class.create(Person, {
	price: function() { /* ... */ }
});
var alex = new Student("Alex");
alex.pay();

To add class properties, set them directly on the class:

Person.find = function(id){ /* ... */ };

HJS’ API also includes a few utility functions, such as clone()and equal():

var alex = new Student("Alex");
var bill = alex.clone();
assert( alex.equal(bill) );

HJS isn’t your only option;  Spine also has a class implementation. To use it, just include
spine.js in the page:

<script src="http://maccman.github.com/spine/spine.js"> </script>
<script>
var Person = Spine.Class.create();
Person.extend({
	find: function() { /* ... */ }
});
Person.include({
	init: function(atts){
		this.attributes = atts || {};
	}
});
var person = Person.init();
</script>

Spine’s class library has a similar API to the library we’ve been building throughout this
chapter. Use  extend() to add class properties and  include() to add instance properties.
To inherit from them, pass parent classes to the Spine.Class instantiator.

If you’re widening your gaze beyond jQuery,  Prototypeis definitely worth checking
out. It has an excellent class API that was the inspiration for a lot of other libraries.
jQuery’s John Resig has an interesting post on implementing classical  inheritance with
the library. It’s well worth reading, especially if you’re interested in the nitty-gritty
behind the JavaScript prototype system.
