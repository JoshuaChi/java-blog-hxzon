CHAPTER 3 Models and Data

注释by hxzon
========
One of the challenges with moving state to the client side is data management. Tradi-tionally,  you could fetch data directly from the database during the page request, in-teroperating the result directly into the page. However, data management in stateful
JavaScript applications is a completely different process. There’s no request/response
model, and you don’t have access to server-side variables. Instead, data is fetched re-motely and stored temporarily on the client side.
Although making this transition can be a hassle, there are a few advantages. For ex-ample, client-side data access is practically instantaneous, as you’re just fetching it from
memory. This can make a real difference to your application’s interface; any interaction
with the application gives immediate feedback, often dramatically improving the user’s
experience.
How you architect data storage on the client side requires some thought. This is an
area riddled with pitfalls and potential traps, often tripping up less-experienced devel-opers—especially as their applications get larger. In this chapter, we’ll cover how best
to make that transition, and I’ll give you some recommended patterns and practices.
MVC and Namespacing
Ensuring that there’s a clear separation between your application’s views, state, and
data is crucial to keeping its architecture uncluttered and sustainable. With the MVC
pattern, data management happens in models (the “M” of MVC). Models should be
decoupled from views and controllers. Any logic associated with data manipulation
and behavior should reside in models and be namespaced properly.
In JavaScript, you can namespace functions and variables by making them properties
of an object. For example:
var User = {
records: [ /* ... */ ]
};

The array of users is namespaced properly under User.records.  Functions associated
with users can also be namespaced under the Usermodel. For example, we can have a
fetchRemote()function for fetching user data from a server:
var User = {
records: [],
fetchRemote: function(){ /* ... */ }
};
Keeping all of a model’s properties under a namespace ensures that you don’t get any
conflicts and that it’s MVC-compliant. It also prevents your code from spiraling down
into a tangled mess of functions and callbacks.
You can take namespacing a step further and keep any functions specific to user in-stances on the actual user objects. Let’s say we had a  destroy()function for user re-cords; it refers to specific users, so it should be on Userinstances:
var user = new User;
user.destroy()
To achieve that, we need to make Usera class, rather than a plain object:
var User = function(atts){
this.attributes = atts || {};
};
User.prototype.destroy = function(){
/* ... */
};
Any functions and variables that don’t relate to specific users can be properties directly
on the Userobject:
User.fetchRemote = function(){
/* ... */
};
For more information about namespacing, visit Peter Michaux’s blog, where he’s
written an excellent articleon the subject.
Building an ORM
Object-relational mappers, or ORMs, are typically used in languages other than Java-Script. However, they’re a very useful technique for data management as well as a great
way of using models in your JavaScript application. With an ORM, for example, you
can tie up a model with a remote server—any changes to model instances will send
background Ajax requests to the server. Or, you could tie up a model instance with an
HTML element—any changes to the instance will be reflected in the view. I’ll elaborate
on those examples later, but for now, let’s look at creating a custom ORM.
Essentially, an ORM is just an object layer wrapping some data. Typically, ORMs are
used to abstract SQL databases, but in our case, the ORM will just be abstracting

JavaScript data types. The advantage of this extra layer is that we can enhance the basic
data with more functionality by adding our own custom functions and properties. This
lets us add things like validation, observers, persistence, and server callbacks while still
being able to reuse a lot of code.
Prototypal Inheritance
We’re going to use Object.create()to construct our ORM, which is a little different
from the class-based examples we covered in  Chapter 1. This will allow us to use
prototype-based inheritance, rather than using constructor functions and the  new
keyword.
Object.create()takes one argument, a prototype object, and returns a new object with
the specified prototype object. In other words, you give it an object, and it returns a
new one, inheriting from the one you specified.
Object.create()was recently added to ECMAScript, 5th Edition, so it isn’t implemen-ted in some browsers, such as IE. However, this doesn’t pose a problem since we can
easily add support if needed:
if (typeof Object.create !== "function")
Object.create = function(o) {
function F() {}
F.prototype = o;
return new F();
};
The example above was taken from Douglas Crockford’s article on Prototypal Inheri-tance. Check it out if you want a more in-depth explanation behind JavaScript proto-types and inheritance.
We’re going to create a Modelobject, which will be in charge of creating new models
and instances:
var Model = {
inherited: function(){},
created: function(){},
prototype: {
init: function(){}
},
create: function(){
var object = Object.create(this);
object.parent = this;
object.prototype = object.fn = Object.create(this.prototype);
object.created();
this.inherited(object);
return object;
},

init: function(){
var instance = Object.create(this.prototype);
instance.parent = this;
instance.init.apply(instance, arguments);
return instance;
}
};
If  you’re unfamiliar with  Object.create(), this may look daunting, so let’s break it
down. The create()function returns a new object, inheriting from the  Modelobject;
we’ll use this for creating new models. The init()function returns a new object, in-heriting from Model.prototype—i.e., an instance of the Modelobject:
var Asset = Model.create();
var User = Model.create();
var user = User.init();
Adding ORM Properties
Now, if we add properties to Model, they’ll be available on all inherited models:
// Add object properties
jQuery.extend(Model, {
find: function(){}
});
// Add instance properties
jQuery.extend(Model.prototype, {
init: function(atts) {
if (atts) this.load(atts);
},
load: function(attributes){
for(var name in attributes)
this[name] = attributes[name];
}
});
jQuery.extend()is just a shorthand way of using a  forloop to copy over properties
manually, which is similar to what we’re doing in the load()function. Now, our object
and instance properties are propagating down to our individual models:
assertEqual( typeof Asset.find, "function" );
In fact, we’re going to be adding a lot of properties, so we might as well make
extend()and include()part of the Modelobject:
var Model = {
/* ... snip ... */
extend: function(o){
var extended = o.extended;
jQuery.extend(this, o);
if (extended) extended(this);

},
include: function(o){
var included = o.included;
jQuery.extend(this.prototype, o);
if (included) included(this);
}
};
// Add object properties
Model.extend({
find: function(){}
});
// Add instance properties
Model.include({
init: function(atts) { /* ... */ },
load: function(attributes){ /* ... */ }
});
Now, we can create new assets and set some attributes:
var asset = Asset.init({name: "foo.png"});
Persisting Records
We need a way of persisting records—i.e., of saving a reference to created instances so
we can access them later. We’ll do that using a recordsobject, set on the Model. When
we’re saving an instance, we’ll add it to that object; when deleting instances, we’ll
remove them from the object:
// An object of saved assets
Model.records = {};
Model.include({
newRecord: true,
create: function(){
this.newRecord = false;
this.parent.records[this.id] = this;
},
destroy: function(){
delete this.parent.records[this.id];
}
});
What about updating an existing instance? Easy—just update the object reference:
Model.include({
update: function(){
this.parent.records[this.id] = this;
}
});

Let’s create a convenience function to save an instance, so we don’t have to check to
see whether the instance was saved previously, or whether it needs to be created:
// Save the object to the records hash, keeping a reference to it
Model.include({
save: function(){
this.newRecord ? this.create() : this.update(); 
}
});
And what about implementing that find()function, so we can find assets by their ID?
Model.extend({
// Find by ID, or raise an exception
find: function(id){
return this.records[id] || throw("Unknown record");
}
});
Now that we’ve succeeded in creating a basic ORM, let’s try it out:
var asset = Asset.init();
asset.name = "same, same";
asset.id = 1
asset.save();
var asset2 = Asset.init();
asset2.name = "but different";
asset2.id = 2;
asset2.save();
assertEqual( Asset.find(1).name, "same, same" );
asset2.destroy();
Adding ID Support
At the moment, every time we save a record we have to specify an ID manually. This
sucks, but fortunately, it’s something we can automate. First, we need a way of gener-ating IDs, which we can do with a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) generator. Well,
technically, JavaScript can’t generate official, bona fide 128-bit GUIDs for API
reasons—it can only generate pseudorandom numbers. Generating truly random
GUIDs is a notoriously difficult problem, and operating systems calculate them using
the MAC address, mouse position, and BIOS checksums, or by measuring electrical
noise or radioactive decay—and even lava lamps! However, JavaScript’s native
Math.random(), although pseudorandom, will be enough for our needs.
Robert Kieffer has written an easy and succinct GUID generator that uses  Math.ran
dom()to generate pseudorandom GUIDs. It’s so simple that we can put it inline:
Math.guid = function(){
return 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'.replace(/[xy]/g, function(c) {
var r = Math.random()*16|0, v = c == 'x' ? r : (r&0x3|0x8);

return v.toString(16);
}).toUpperCase(); 
};
Now  that we have a function to generate GUIDs, integrating that into our ORM is
simple; all we need to change is the create()function:
Model.extend({
create: function(){
if ( !this.id ) this.id = Math.guid();
this.newRecord = false;
this.parent.records[this.id] = this;
}
});
Now, any newly created records have random GUIDs as their ID:
var asset = Asset.init();
asset.save();
asset.id //=> "54E52592-313E-4F8B-869B-58D61F00DC74"
Addressing References
If you’ve been observing closely, you might have spotted a bug relating to the references
in our ORM. We’re not cloning instances when they’re returned by  find()or when
we’re saving them, so if we change any properties, they’re changed on the original asset.
This is a problem because we only want assets to update when we call the  update()
function:
var asset = new Asset({name: "foo"});
asset.save();
// Assert passes correctly
assertEqual( Asset.find(asset.id).name, "foo" );
// Let's change a property, but not call update()
asset.name = "wem";
// Oh dear! This assert fails, as the asset's name is now "wem"
assertEqual( Asset.find(asset.id).name, "foo" );
Let’s fix that by creating a new object during the find()operation. We’ll also need to
duplicate the object whenever we create or update the record:
Asset.extend({
find: function(id){
var record = this.records[id];
if ( !record ) throw("Unknown record");
return record.dup();
}
});
Asset.include({

create: function(){
this.newRecord = false;
this.parent.records[this.id] = this.dup();
},
update: function(){
this.parent.records[this.id] = this.dup();
},
dup: function(){
return jQuery.extend(true, {}, this);
}
});
We have another problem—Model.recordsis an object shared by every model:
assertEqual( Asset.records, Person.records );
This has the unfortunate side effect of mixing up all the records:
var asset = Asset.init();
asset.save();
assert( asset in Person.records );
The solution is to set a new  recordsobject whenever we create a new model. Model.cre
ated()is the callback for new object creation, so we can set any objects that are specific
to the model in there:
Model.extend({
created: function(){
this.records = {};
}
});
Loading in Data
Unless your web application is entirely restricted to the browser, you’ll need to load in
remote data from a server. Typically, a subset of data is loaded when the application
starts, and more data is loaded after the interaction. Depending on the type of appli-cation and the amount of data, you may be able to load everything you need on the
initial page load. This is ideal, so users never have to wait for more data to be loaded.
However, this isn’t feasible for a lot of applications because there’s too much data to
fit comfortably in a browser’s memory.
Preloading data is crucial to making your application feel slick and fast to your users,
keeping any waiting time to a minimum. However, there’s a fine line between preload-ing data that’s actually accessed and loading redundant data that’s never used. You
need to predict what sort of data your users will want (or use metrics once your appli-cation is live).

If you’re displaying a paginated list, why not preload the next page so transitions are
instant? Or, even better, just display a long list and automatically load and insert data
as the list is scrolled (the infinite scroll pattern). The less latency a user feels, the better.
When you do fetch new data, make sure the UI isn’t blocked. Display some sort of
loading indicator, but make sure the interface is still usable. There should be very few
scenarios, if any, that require blocking the UI.
Data can be present inline in the initial page or loaded with separate HTTP requests
through Ajax or JSONP. Personally, I would recommend the latter two technologies,
as including a lot of data inline increases the page size, whereas parallel requests load
faster. AJAX and JSON also let you cache the HTML page, rather than dynamically
render it for every request.
Including Data Inline
I don’t really advocate this approach for the reasons I outlined in the previous para-graph, but it can be useful in specific situations, especially for loading in a very small
amount of data. This technique has the advantage of being really simple to implement.
All you need to do is render a JSON object directly into the page. For example, here’s
how you’d do it with Ruby on Rails:
<script type="text/javascript">
var User = {};
User.records = <%= raw @users.to_json %>;
</script>
We’re using ERB tags to output a JSON interpretation of the user data. The rawmethod 
is simply to stop the JSON from being escaped. When the page is rendered, the resulting
HTML looks like this:
<script type="text/javascript">
var User = {};
User.records = [{"first_name": "Alex"}];
</script>
JavaScript can just evaluate the JSON as-is because it has the same structure as a Java-Script object.
Loading Data with Ajax
This is probably the first method of loading remote data that springs to mind when you
hear background requests, and for good reason: it’s tried, tested, and supported in all
modern browsers. That’s not to say that Ajax is without its drawbacks—its unstan-dardized history has resulted in an inconsistent API and, due to browser security,
loading data from different domains is tricky.

If you need a short primer on Ajax and the  XMLHttpRequest  class, read “Getting Started,”
a Mozilla Developer article. In all likelihood, though, you’ll end up using a library like
jQuery that abstracts Ajax’s API, massaging out the differences among browsers. For
that reason, we’ll cover jQuery’s API here, rather than the raw XMLHttpRequestclass.
jQuery’s Ajax API consists of one low-level function,  jQuery.ajax(), and several higher-level abstractions of it, reducing the amount of code you need to write.  jQuery
.ajax()takes a hash of settings for request parameters, content type, and callbacks,
among others. As soon as you call the function, the request is asynchronously sent in
the background.
url
The request url. The default is the current page.
success
A function to be called if the request succeeds. Any data returned from the server
is passed as a parameter.
contentType
Sets the  Content-Typeheader of the request. If the request contains data, the default
is application/x-www-form-urlencoded, which is fine for most use cases.
data
The data to be sent to the server. If it’s not already a string, jQuery will serialize
and URL-encode it.
type
The HTTP method to use: GET, POST, or DELETE. The default is GET.
dataType
The type of data you’re expecting back from the server. jQuery needs to know this
so it knows what to do with the result. If you don’t specify a dataType, jQuery will
do some intelligent guessing based on the MIME type of the response. Supported
values are:
text
Plain-text response; no processing is needed.
script
jQuery evaluates the response as JavaScript.
json
jQuery evaluates the response as JSON, using a strict parser.
jsonp
For JSONP requests, which we’ll cover in detail later.
For example, let’s do a simple Ajax request, which alerts whatever data returned by the
server:
jQuery.ajax({
url: "/ajax/endpoint",
type: "GET",

success: function(data) {
alert(data);
}
});
However,  all those options are a bit verbose. Luckily, jQuery has a few shortcuts.
jQuery.get()takes a URL and optional data and callback:
jQuery.get("/ajax/endpoint", function(data){
$(".ajaxResult").text(data);
});
Or, if we want to send a few query parameters with the GETrequest:
jQuery.get("/ajax/endpoint", {foo: "bar"}, function(data){
/* ... */
});
If we’re expecting JSON back from the server, we need to call  jQuery.getJSON()instead,
which sets the request’s dataTypeoption to "json":
jQuery.getJSON("/json/endpoint", function(json){
/* ... */
});
Likewise, there’s a jQuery.post()function, which also takes a URL, data, and callback:
jQuery.post("/users", {first_name: "Alex"}, function(result){
/* Ajax POST was a success */
});
If you want to use other HTTP methods—DELETE,  HEAD, and  OPTIONS—you’ll have to
use the lower-level jQuery.ajax()function.
That was a brief overview of jQuery’s Ajax API, but if you need more information, read
the full documentation.
A limitation of Ajax is the same origin policy, which restricts requests to the same do-main, subdomain, and port as the address of the page from which they’re made. There’s
a good reason for this: whenever an Ajax request is sent, all that domain’s cookie in-formation is sent along with the request. That means, to the remote server, the request
appears to be from a logged-in user. Without the same origin policy, an attacker could
potentially fetch all your emails from Gmail, update your Facebook status, or direct
message your followers on Twitter—quite a security flaw.
However, while the same origin policy is integral to the security of the Web, it’s also
somewhat inconvenient for developers trying to access legitimate remote resources.
Other technologies like Adobe Flash and Java have implemented workarounds to the
problem with cross-domain policy files, and now Ajax is catching up with a standard
called CORS, or cross-origin resource sharing.
CORS lets you break out of the same origin policy, giving you access to authorized
remote servers. The specification is well supported by the major browsers, so unless
you’re using IE6, you should be fine.

CORS support by browser:
• IE >= 8 (with caveats)
• Firefox >= 3
• Safari: full support
• Chrome: full support
• Opera: no support
Using CORS is trivially easy. If you want to authorize access to your server, just add a
few lines to the HTTP header of returned responses:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: GET,POST
The above header will authorize cross-origin GET and POST requests from  exam-ple.com. You should separate multiple values with commas, as with the  GET,POSTvalues
above. To allow access from additional domains, just list them comma-separated in
the  Access-Control-Allow-Originheader. Or, to give any domain access, just set the
origin header to an asterisk (*).
Some browsers, like Safari, will first make an OPTIONS request to check whether the
request is allowed. Firefox, on the other hand, will make the request and just raise a
security exception if the CORS headers aren’t set. You’ll need to take account of this
different behavior server side.
You can even authorize custom request headers using the  Access-Control-Request-Headersheader:
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization
This means that clients can add custom headers to Ajax requests, such as signing the
request with OAuth:
var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
req.open("POST", "/endpoint", true); 
req.setRequestHeader("Authorization", oauth_signature);
Unfortunately, while CORS works with versions of Internet Explorer 8 and higher,
Microsoft chose to ignore the spec and the working group. Microsoft created its own
object, XDomainRequest, which is to be used instead of  XMLHttpRequestfor cross-domain
requests. While its interface is similar to XMLHttpRequest’s, it has a number of restric-tions and limitations. For example, only GET and POST methods work, no authenti-cation or custom headers are supported, and finally, the kicker—only the “Content-Type: text/plain” is supported. If you’re prepared to work around those restrictions,
then—with the correct Access-Controlheaders—you can get CORS working in IE.

JSONP
JSONP,  or JSON with padding, was created before CORS was standardized, and is
another way of fetching data from remote servers. The idea is that you have a script tag
that points to a JSON endpoint where returned data is wrapped in a function invoca-tion. Script tags aren’t subject to any cross-domain limitations, and this technique is
supported in practically every browser.
So, here we have a script tag that points to our remote server:
<script src="http://example.com/data.json"> </script>
Then the endpoint, data.json, returns a JSON object wrapped in a function invocation:
jsonCallback({"data": "foo"})
We then define a globally accessible function. Once the script has loaded, this function
will be called:
window.jsonCallback = function(result){
// Do stuff with the result
}
As it is, this is a fairly convoluted process. Luckily, jQuery wraps it in a succinct API:
jQuery.getJSON("http://example.com/data.json?callback=?", function(result){
// Do stuff with the result
});
jQuery replaces the last question mark in the above URL with a random name of a
temporary function it creates. Your server needs to read the  callbackparameter and
use that as the name of the returned wrapping function.
Security with Cross-Domain Requests
If you’re opening up your server to cross-origin requests or JSONP from any domain,
you’ve got to really think about security. Usually the cross-origin domain policy stops
an attacker from calling, say, Twitter’s API, and fetching your personal data. CORS
and JSONP change all of that. As with a normal Ajax request, all your session cookies
are passed with the request, so you’ll be logged into Twitter’s API. Any potential at-tackers have full control over your account; security considerations are therefore
paramount.
With this in mind, here are some key points to take into account when using CORS/
JSONP if you’re not controlling which domains can access your API:
• Don’t reveal any sensitive information, such as email addresses.
• Don’t allow any actions (like a Twitter “follow”).
Or, alternatively, to mitigate those security issues, just have a whitelist of domains that
can connect, or you can use OAuth authentication exclusively.

Populating Our ORM
Populating our ORM with data is pretty straightforward. All we need to do is fetch the
data from the server and then update our model’s records. Let’s add a populate()func-tion to the Modelobject, which will iterate over any values given, create instances, and
update the recordsobject:
Model.extend({
populate: function(values){
// Reset model & records
this.records = {};
for (var i=0, il = values.length; i < il; i++) { 
var record = this.init(values[i]);
record.newRecord = false;
this.records[record.id] = record;
}
}
});
Now, we can use the Model.populate()function with the result of our request for data:
jQuery.getJSON("/assets", function(result){
Asset.populate(result);
});
Any records the server returned will now be available in our ORM.
Storing Data Locally
In the past, local data storage was a pain in the neck. The only options available to use
were cookies and plug-ins like Adobe Flash. Cookies had an antiquated API, couldn’t
store much data, and sent all the data back to the server on every request, adding
unnecessary overhead. As for Flash, well, let’s try and steer clear of plug-ins if possible.
Fortunately, support for local storage was included in HTML5 and is implemented in
the major browsers. Unlike cookies, data is stored exclusively on the client side and is
never sent to servers. You can also store a great deal more data—the maximum amount
differs per browser (and version number, as listed below), but they all offer at least
5 MB per domain:

• IE >= 8
• Firefox >= 3.5
• Safari >= 4
• Chrome >= 4
• Opera >= 10.6
HTML5 storage comes under the HTML5 Web Storage specification, and consists of
two types: local storageand session storage. Local storage persists after the browser is
closed; session storage persists only for the lifetime of the window. Any data stored is
scoped by domain and is only accessible to scripts from the domain that originally
stored the data.
You can access and manipulate local storage and session storage using the  local
Storageand  sessionStorageobjects, respectively. The API is very similar to setting
properties on a JavaScript object and, apart from the two objects, is identical for both
local and session storage:
// Setting a value
localStorage["someData"] = "wem";
There are a few more features to the WebStorage API:
// How many items are stored
var itemsStored = localStorage.length;
// Set an item (aliased to a hash syntax)
localStorage.setItem("someData", "wem");
// Get a stored item, returning null if unknown
localStorage.getItem("someData"); //=> "wem";
// Delete an item, returning null if unknown
localStorage.removeItem("someData");
// Clear all items
localStorage.clear();
Data is stored as strings, so if you intend on saving any objects or integers, you’ll have
to do your own conversion. To do this using JSON, serialize the objects into JSON
before you save them, and deserialize the JSON strings when fetching them:
var object = {some: "object"};
// Serialize and save an object
localStorage.setItem("seriData", JSON.stringify(object));
// Load and deserialize an object
var result = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("seriData"));
If you go over your storage quota (usually 5 MB per host), a  QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERRwill
be raised when saving additional data.

Adding Local Storage to Our ORM
Let’s add local storage support to our ORM so that records can be persisted between
page refreshes. To use the localStorageobject, we need to serialize our records into a
JSON string. The problem is that, at the moment, serialized objects look like this:
var json = JSON.stringify(Asset.init({name: "foo"}));
json //=> "{"parent":{"parent":{"prototype":{}},"records":[]},"name":"foo"}"
So, we need to override JSON’s serialization of our models. First, we need to determine
which properties need to be serialized. Let’s add an  attributesarray to the  Model
object, which individual models can use to specify their attributes:
Model.extend({
created: function(){
this.records = {};
this.attributes = [];
}
});
Asset.attributes = ["name", "ext"];
Because every model has different attributes—and therefore can’t share the same array
reference—the attributesproperty isn’t set directly on the Model. Instead, we’re cre-ating a new array when a model is first created, similar to what we’re doing with the
recordsobject.
Now, let’s create an attributes()function, which will return an object of attributes to
values:
Model.include({
attributes: function(){
var result = {};
for(var i in this.parent.attributes) {
var attr = this.parent.attributes[i];
result[attr] = this[attr];
}
result.id = this.id;
return result;
}
});
Now, we can set an array of attributes for every model:
Asset.attributes = ["name", "ext"];
And the attributes()function will return an object with the correct properties:
var asset = Asset.init({name: "document", ext: ".txt"});
asset.attributes(); //=> {name: "document", ext: ".txt"};
As for the overriding of JSON.stringify(), all that’s needed is a  toJSON()method on
model instances. The JSON library will use that function to find the object to serialize,
rather than serializing the recordsobject as-is:

Model.include({
toJSON: function(){
return(this.attributes());
}
});
Let’s try serializing the records again. This time, the resultant JSON will contain the
correct properties:
var json = JSON.stringify(Asset.records);
json //= "{"7B2A9E8D...":"{"name":"document","ext":".txt","id":"7B2A9E8D..."}"}"
Now that we’ve got JSON serializing working smoothly, adding local storage support
to our models is trivial. We’ll add two functions onto our  Model:  saveLocal()and
loadLocal(). When saving, we’ll convert the  Model.recordsobject into an array, seri-alize it, and send it to localStorage:
var Model.LocalStorage = {
saveLocal: function(name){
// Turn records into an array
var result = [];
for (var i in this.records)
result.push(this.records[i])
localStorage[name] = JSON.stringify(result);
},
loadLocal: function(name){
var result = JSON.parse(localStorage[name]);
this.populate(result);
}
};
Asset.extend(Model.LocalStorage);
It’s probably a good idea for the records to be read from the local storage when the
page loads and to be saved when the page is closed. That, however, will be left as an
exercise for the reader.
Submitting New Records to the Server
Earlier, we covered how to use jQuery’s post()function to send data to the server. The
function takes three arguments: the endpoint URL, request data, and a callback:
jQuery.post("/users", {first_name: "Alex"}, function(result){
/* Ajax POST was a success */
});
Now that we have an attributes()function, creating records to the server is simple—
just POST the record’s attributes:
jQuery.post("/assets", asset.attributes(), function(result){
/* Ajax POST was a success */
});

If we’re following REST conventions, we’ll want to do an HTTP POST when creating
a  record and a PUT request when updating the record. Let’s add two functions to Model
instances—createRemote()and  updateRemote()—which will send the correct HTTP
request type to our server:
Model.include({
createRemote: function(url, callback){
$.post(url, this.attributes(), callback);
},
updateRemote: function(url, callback){
$.ajax({
url: url, 
data: this.attributes(), 
success: callback,
type: "PUT"
});
}
});
Now if we call createRemote()on an Asset instance, its attributes will be POSTed to
the server:
// Usage:
Asset.init({name: "jason.txt"}).createRemote("/assets");
