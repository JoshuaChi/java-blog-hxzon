7.1. Overview

The process of retrieving or the command to retrieve data from a database is called a query. 
In SQL the SELECT command is used to specify queries. 
The general syntax of the SELECT command is
语法：

[WITH with_queries] SELECT select_list FROM table_expression [sort_specification]

The following sections describe the details of the select list, the table expression, and the sort specification. 
WITH queries are treated last since they are an advanced feature.

A simple kind of query has the form:

SELECT * FROM table1;

Assuming that there is a table called table1, this command would retrieve all rows and all user-defined columns from table1. 
(The method of retrieval depends on the client application. 
For example, the psql program will display an ASCII-art table on the screen, 
while client libraries will offer functions to extract individual values from the query result.) 

The select list specification * means all columns that the table expression happens to provide. 
A select list can also select a subset of the available columns or make calculations using the columns. 
For example, if table1 has columns named a, b, and c (and perhaps others) you can make the following query:

SELECT a, b + c FROM table1;

(assuming that b and c are of a numerical data type). 
See Section 7.3 for more details.

FROM table1 is a simple kind of table expression: it reads just one table. 
In general, table expressions can be complex constructs of base tables, joins, and subqueries. 
But you can also omit the table expression entirely and use the SELECT command as a calculator:
如果不需要表，可以不用from子句。（hxzon：MySQL也是如此，但oracle必须用from dual 。）

SELECT 3 * 4;

This is more useful if the expressions in the select list return varying results. 
For example, you could call a function this way:
随机数：

SELECT random();

============
7.2. Table Expressions

A table expression computes a table. 
The table expression contains a FROM clause that is optionally followed by WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses. 
Trivial table expressions simply refer to a table on disk, a so-called base table, 
but more complex expressions can be used to modify or combine base tables in various ways.

The optional WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses in the table expression 
specify a pipeline of successive transformations performed on the table derived in the FROM clause. 
All these transformations produce a virtual 
table that provides the rows that are passed to the select list to compute the output rows of the query.

============
7.2.1. The FROM Clause
from子句

The FROM Clause derives a table from one or more other tables given in a comma-separated table reference list.

FROM table_reference [, table_reference [, ...]]

A table reference can be a table name (possibly schema-qualified), 
or a derived table such as a subquery, a table join, or complex combinations of these. 
If more than one table reference is listed in the FROM clause they are cross-joined (see below) 
to form the intermediate virtual table that can then be subject to transformations by the WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses 
and is finally the result of the overall table expression.

When a table reference names a table that is the parent of a table inheritance hierarchy,
如果一个表是层级关系中的父亲， 
the table reference produces rows of not only that table but all of its descendant tables,
则对这个表的使用，会包括它的所有孩子， 
unless the key word ONLY precedes the table name.
除非在表名前使用关键字only。 
However, the reference produces only the columns that appear in the named table 
— any columns added in subtables are ignored.
但是，列则只包括这个父亲表的列，不会包括它的孩子表的额外列。

Instead of writing ONLY before the table name, you can write * after the table name 
to explicitly specify that descendant tables are included. 
Writing * is not necessary since that behavior is the default 
(unless you have changed the setting of the sql_inheritance configuration option). 
However writing * might be useful to emphasize that additional tables will be searched.
与关键字only的作用相反，在表名前使用星号，则会包括孩子表。
默认情况下，本来就包括孩子表。

7.2.1.1. Joined Tables
被关联的表

A joined table is a table derived from two other (real or derived) tables according to the rules of the particular join type. 
Inner, outer, and cross-joins are available.

Join Types

Cross join 笛卡尔联接
T1 CROSS JOIN T2
For every possible combination of rows from T1 and T2 (i.e., a Cartesian product), 
the joined table will contain a row consisting of all columns in T1 followed by all columns in T2. 
If the tables have N and M rows respectively, the joined table will have N * M rows.

FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T2 is equivalent to FROM T1, T2. 
It is also equivalent to FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 ON TRUE (see below).
它等价于逗号隔开表名的from子句，也等价于上述内联接。

Qualified joins
T1 { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN T2 ON boolean_expression
T1 { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN T2 USING ( join column list )
T1 NATURAL { [INNER] | { LEFT | RIGHT | FULL } [OUTER] } JOIN T2

The words INNER and OUTER are optional in all forms. 
INNER is the default; LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL imply an outer join.
inner和outer两个关键字都是可选的。
inner是默认联接，而left，right，full都是外联接。

The join condition is specified in the ON or USING clause, or implicitly by the word NATURAL. 
The join condition determines which rows from the two source tables 
are considered to "match", as explained in detail below.

The ON clause is the most general kind of join condition: 
it takes a Boolean value expression of the same kind as is used in a WHERE clause. 
A pair of rows from T1 and T2 match if the ON expression evaluates to true for them.
on子句跟着一个布尔表达式。

USING is a shorthand notation: it takes a comma-separated list of column names, which the joined tables must have in common, 
and forms a join condition specifying equality of each of these pairs of columns. 
Furthermore, the output of JOIN USING has one column for each of the equated pairs of input columns, 
followed by the remaining columns from each table. 
Thus, USING (a, b, c) is equivalent to ON (t1.a = t2.a AND t1.b = t2.b AND t1.c = t2.c) 
with the exception that if ON is used there will be two columns a, b, and c in the result, 
whereas with USING there will be only one of each (and they will appear first if SELECT * is used).
using子句是一种简写方式，两个表必须含有该子句指定的列，当对应的列值都相同时匹配。
当使用select * 时，它也控制了返回的列，即指定列只返回一次，且在最前面，随后跟着每个表的额外列。

Finally, NATURAL is a shorthand form of USING: 
it forms a USING list consisting of all column names that appear in both input tables. 
As with USING, these columns appear only once in the output table. 
If there are no common columns, NATURAL behaves like CROSS JOIN.
natural是一种比using更简写的方式，使用两个表的所有同名列。

The possible types of qualified join are:

INNER JOIN 内联接
For each row R1 of T1, the joined table has a row for each row in T2 that satisfies the join condition with R1.

LEFT OUTER JOIN 左外联接，左表的每行都会出现
First, an inner join is performed. 
Then, for each row in T1 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T2, 
a joined row is added with null values in columns of T2. 
Thus, the joined table always has at least one row for each row in T1.

RIGHT OUTER JOIN 右外联接，右表的每行都会出现
First, an inner join is performed. 
Then, for each row in T2 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T1, 
a joined row is added with null values in columns of T1. 
This is the converse of a left join: the result table will always have a row for each row in T2.

FULL OUTER JOIN 全外联接，左表，右表的每行都会出现
First, an inner join is performed. 
Then, for each row in T1 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T2, 
a joined row is added with null values in columns of T2. 
Also, for each row of T2 that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in T1, 
a joined row with null values in the columns of T1 is added.

Joins of all types can be chained together or nested: either or both T1 and T2 can be joined tables. 
Parentheses can be used around JOIN clauses to control the join order. 
In the absence of parentheses, JOIN clauses nest left-to-right.
各种联接类型可以相互嵌套，默认从左向右嵌套。
可以使用括号改变联接顺序。

To put this together, assume we have tables t1:

 num | name
-----+------
   1 | a
   2 | b
   3 | c
and t2:

 num | value
-----+-------
   1 | xxx
   3 | yyy
   5 | zzz

then we get the following results for the various joins:

=> SELECT * FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   1 | a    |   3 | yyy
   1 | a    |   5 | zzz
   2 | b    |   1 | xxx
   2 | b    |   3 | yyy
   2 | b    |   5 | zzz
   3 | c    |   1 | xxx
   3 | c    |   3 | yyy
   3 | c    |   5 | zzz
(9 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   3 | c    |   3 | yyy
(2 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 USING (num);
 num | name | value
-----+------+-------
   1 | a    | xxx
   3 | c    | yyy
(2 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 NATURAL INNER JOIN t2;
 num | name | value
-----+------+-------
   1 | a    | xxx
   3 | c    | yyy
(2 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   2 | b    |     |
   3 | c    |   3 | yyy
(3 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 USING (num);
 num | name | value
-----+------+-------
   1 | a    | xxx
   2 | b    |
   3 | c    | yyy
(3 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   3 | c    |   3 | yyy
     |      |   5 | zzz
(3 rows)

=> SELECT * FROM t1 FULL JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   2 | b    |     |
   3 | c    |   3 | yyy
     |      |   5 | zzz
(4 rows)

The join condition specified with ON can also contain conditions that do not relate directly to the join. 
This can prove useful for some queries but needs to be thought out carefully. 
For example:
on子句的布尔表达式可以和联接毫无相关：

=> SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num AND t2.value = 'xxx';
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
   2 | b    |     |
   3 | c    |     |
(3 rows)

hxzon：注意上述返回结果。左联接。

Notice that placing the restriction in the WHERE clause produces a different result:

=> SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num WHERE t2.value = 'xxx';
 num | name | num | value
-----+------+-----+-------
   1 | a    |   1 | xxx
(1 row)

This is because a restriction placed in the ON clause is processed before the join, 
while a restriction placed in the WHERE clause is processed after the join.
on的条件是在联接时执行，而where子句是在联接后才执行。

====
7.2.1.2. Table and Column Aliases
表和列的别名

A temporary name can be given to tables and complex table references 
to be used for references to the derived table in the rest of the query. 
This is called a table alias.

To create a table alias, write

FROM table_reference AS alias

or

FROM table_reference alias

The AS key word is optional noise. alias can be any identifier.
as关键字是可选的。

A typical application of table aliases is to assign short identifiers to long table names 
to keep the join clauses readable. For example:

SELECT * FROM some_very_long_table_name s JOIN another_fairly_long_name a ON s.id = a.num;

The alias becomes the new name of the table reference so far as the current query is concerned 
— it is not allowed to refer to the table by the original name elsewhere in the query.
一旦使用了别名，就不允许再使用表的原名，如下例子是错误的。 
Thus, this is not valid:

SELECT * FROM my_table AS m WHERE my_table.a > 5;    -- wrong

Table aliases are mainly for notational convenience, but it is necessary to use them when joining a table to itself, e.g.:

SELECT * FROM people AS mother JOIN people AS child ON mother.id = child.mother_id;

Additionally, an alias is required if the table reference is a subquery (see Section 7.2.1.3).

Parentheses are used to resolve ambiguities. 
In the following example, the first statement assigns the alias b to the second instance of my_table, 
but the second statement assigns the alias to the result of the join:

SELECT * FROM my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table AS b ...
SELECT * FROM (my_table AS a CROSS JOIN my_table) AS b ...

Another form of table aliasing gives temporary names to the columns of the table, as well as the table itself:

FROM table_reference [AS] alias ( column1 [, column2 [, ...]] )

hxzon：注意上述语法。在from子句，给表指定别名的同时，也给列指定了别名。

If fewer column aliases are specified than the actual table has columns, 
the remaining columns are not renamed. 
This syntax is especially useful for self-joins or subqueries.
如果别名列表不足，则其余列使用原名。

When an alias is applied to the output of a JOIN clause, 
the alias hides the original name(s) within the JOIN. For example:

SELECT a.* FROM my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...

is valid SQL, but:

SELECT a.* FROM (my_table AS a JOIN your_table AS b ON ...) AS c

is not valid; the table alias a is not visible outside the alias c.
注意，上述语句不合法。整个联接结果命名为c后，a的名字已经不可见。

====
7.2.1.3. Subqueries
子查询

Subqueries specifying a derived table must be enclosed in parentheses 
and must be assigned a table alias name (as in Section 7.2.1.2). For example:
子查询必须使用括号，且必须指定别名。

FROM (SELECT * FROM table1) AS alias_name

This example is equivalent to FROM table1 AS alias_name. 
More interesting cases, which cannot be reduced to a plain join, 
arise when the subquery involves grouping or aggregation.

A subquery can also be a VALUES list:
values列表也可以作为子查询。

FROM (VALUES ('anne', 'smith'), ('bob', 'jones'), ('joe', 'blow'))
     AS names(first, last)

Again, a table alias is required. 
Assigning alias names to the columns of the VALUES list is optional, but is good practice. 
For more information see Section 7.7.
上述例子，给表指定了别名的同时，也指定了列的别名，
对于values列表，这是一个好的实践。

====
7.2.1.4. Table Functions
表函数（hxzon，重点）

Table functions are functions that produce a set of rows,
表函数，指返回一系列行的函数。 
made up of either base data types (scalar types) or composite data types (table rows). 
They are used like a table, view, or subquery in the FROM clause of a query. 
Columns returned by table functions can be included in SELECT, JOIN, or WHERE clauses 
in the same manner as columns of a table, view, or subquery.

Table functions may also be combined using the ROWS FROM syntax, 
with the results returned in parallel columns; 
the number of result rows in this case is that of the largest function result, 
with smaller results padded with NULLs to match.

function_call [WITH ORDINALITY] [[AS] table_alias [(column_alias [, ... ])]]

ROWS FROM( function_call [, ... ] ) [WITH ORDINALITY] [[AS] table_alias [(column_alias [, ... ])]]

If the WITH ORDINALITY clause is specified, 
an additional column of type bigint will be added to the function result columns. 
This column numbers the rows of the function result set, starting from 1. 
(This is a generalization of the SQL-standard syntax for UNNEST ... WITH ORDINALITY.) 
By default, the ordinal column is called ordinality, but a different column name can be assigned to it using an AS clause.
如果使用了with ordinality，则会额外多一列（列名为ordinality，可以通过别名子句重命名），
表示行号，从1开始。


The special table function UNNEST may be called with any number of array parameters, 
and it returns a corresponding number of columns, 
as if UNNEST (Section 9.18) had been called on each parameter separately and combined using the ROWS FROM construct.
表函数unnest，将数组参数转成列。

UNNEST( array_expression [, ... ] ) [WITH ORDINALITY] [[AS] table_alias [(column_alias [, ... ])]]

If no table_alias is specified, the function name is used as the table name; 
in the case of a ROWS FROM() construct, the first function's name is used.

If column aliases are not supplied, then for a function returning a base data type, 
the column name is also the same as the function name. 
For a function returning a composite type, 
the result columns get the names of the individual attributes of the type.

Some examples:

CREATE TABLE foo (fooid int, foosubid int, fooname text);

CREATE FUNCTION getfoo(int) RETURNS SETOF foo AS $$
    SELECT * FROM foo WHERE fooid = $1;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM getfoo(1) AS t1;

SELECT * FROM foo
    WHERE foosubid IN (
                        SELECT foosubid
                        FROM getfoo(foo.fooid) z
                        WHERE z.fooid = foo.fooid
                      );

CREATE VIEW vw_getfoo AS SELECT * FROM getfoo(1);

SELECT * FROM vw_getfoo;

In some cases it is useful to define table functions that 
can return different column sets depending on how they are invoked. 
To support this, the table function can be declared as returning the pseudotype record. 
When such a function is used in a query, 
the expected row structure must be specified in the query itself, 
so that the system can know how to parse and plan the query. 
This syntax looks like:

function_call [AS] alias (column_definition [, ... ])

function_call AS [alias] (column_definition [, ... ])

ROWS FROM( ... function_call AS (column_definition [, ... ]) [, ... ] )

When not using the ROWS FROM() syntax, 
the column_definition list replaces the column alias list that could otherwise be attached to the FROM item; 
the names in the column definitions serve as column aliases. 
When using the ROWS FROM() syntax, 
a column_definition list can be attached to each member function separately; 
or if there is only one member function and no WITH ORDINALITY clause, 
a column_definition list can be written in place of a column alias list following ROWS FROM().

Consider this example:

SELECT *
    FROM dblink('dbname=mydb', 'SELECT proname, prosrc FROM pg_proc')
      AS t1(proname name, prosrc text)
    WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';
The dblink function (part of the dblink module) executes a remote query. It is declared to return record since it might be used for any kind of query. The actual column set must be specified in the calling query so that the parser knows, for example, what * should expand to.

====
7.2.1.5. LATERAL Subqueries

Subqueries appearing in FROM can be preceded by the key word LATERAL. This allows them to reference columns provided by preceding FROM items. (Without LATERAL, each subquery is evaluated independently and so cannot cross-reference any other FROM item.)

Table functions appearing in FROM can also be preceded by the key word LATERAL, but for functions the key word is optional; the function's arguments can contain references to columns provided by preceding FROM items in any case.

A LATERAL item can appear at top level in the FROM list, or within a JOIN tree. In the latter case it can also refer to any items that are on the left-hand side of a JOIN that it is on the right-hand side of.

When a FROM item contains LATERAL cross-references, evaluation proceeds as follows: for each row of the FROM item providing the cross-referenced column(s), or set of rows of multiple FROM items providing the columns, the LATERAL item is evaluated using that row or row set's values of the columns. The resulting row(s) are joined as usual with the rows they were computed from. This is repeated for each row or set of rows from the column source table(s).

A trivial example of LATERAL is

SELECT * FROM foo, LATERAL (SELECT * FROM bar WHERE bar.id = foo.bar_id) ss;
This is not especially useful since it has exactly the same result as the more conventional

SELECT * FROM foo, bar WHERE bar.id = foo.bar_id;
LATERAL is primarily useful when the cross-referenced column is necessary for computing the row(s) to be joined. A common application is providing an argument value for a set-returning function. For example, supposing that vertices(polygon) returns the set of vertices of a polygon, we could identify close-together vertices of polygons stored in a table with:

SELECT p1.id, p2.id, v1, v2
FROM polygons p1, polygons p2,
     LATERAL vertices(p1.poly) v1,
     LATERAL vertices(p2.poly) v2
WHERE (v1 <-> v2) < 10 AND p1.id != p2.id;
This query could also be written

SELECT p1.id, p2.id, v1, v2
FROM polygons p1 CROSS JOIN LATERAL vertices(p1.poly) v1,
     polygons p2 CROSS JOIN LATERAL vertices(p2.poly) v2
WHERE (v1 <-> v2) < 10 AND p1.id != p2.id;
or in several other equivalent formulations. (As already mentioned, the LATERAL key word is unnecessary in this example, but we use it for clarity.)

It is often particularly handy to LEFT JOIN to a LATERAL subquery, so that source rows will appear in the result even if the LATERAL subquery produces no rows for them. For example, if get_product_names() returns the names of products made by a manufacturer, but some manufacturers in our table currently produce no products, we could find out which ones those are like this:

SELECT m.name
FROM manufacturers m LEFT JOIN LATERAL get_product_names(m.id) pname ON true
WHERE pname IS NULL;

========
7.2.2. The WHERE Clause

The syntax of the WHERE Clause is

WHERE search_condition
where search_condition is any value expression (see Section 4.2) that returns a value of type boolean.

After the processing of the FROM clause is done, each row of the derived virtual table is checked against the search condition. If the result of the condition is true, the row is kept in the output table, otherwise (i.e., if the result is false or null) it is discarded. The search condition typically references at least one column of the table generated in the FROM clause; this is not required, but otherwise the WHERE clause will be fairly useless.

Note: The join condition of an inner join can be written either in the WHERE clause or in the JOIN clause. For example, these table expressions are equivalent:
FROM a, b WHERE a.id = b.id AND b.val > 5
and:
FROM a INNER JOIN b ON (a.id = b.id) WHERE b.val > 5
or perhaps even:
FROM a NATURAL JOIN b WHERE b.val > 5
Which one of these you use is mainly a matter of style. The JOIN syntax in the FROM clause is probably not as portable to other SQL database management systems, even though it is in the SQL standard. For outer joins there is no choice: they must be done in the FROM clause. The ON or USING clause of an outer join is not equivalent to a WHERE condition, because it results in the addition of rows (for unmatched input rows) as well as the removal of rows in the final result.
Here are some examples of WHERE clauses:

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 > 5

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (1, 2, 3)

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c1 FROM t2)

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 IN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10)

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE c1 BETWEEN (SELECT c3 FROM t2 WHERE c2 = fdt.c1 + 10) AND 100

SELECT ... FROM fdt WHERE EXISTS (SELECT c1 FROM t2 WHERE c2 > fdt.c1)
fdt is the table derived in the FROM clause. Rows that do not meet the search condition of the WHERE clause are eliminated from fdt. Notice the use of scalar subqueries as value expressions. Just like any other query, the subqueries can employ complex table expressions. Notice also how fdt is referenced in the subqueries. Qualifying c1 as fdt.c1 is only necessary if c1 is also the name of a column in the derived input table of the subquery. But qualifying the column name adds clarity even when it is not needed. This example shows how the column naming scope of an outer query extends into its inner queries.

==========
7.2.3. The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

After passing the WHERE filter, the derived input table might be subject to grouping, using the GROUP BY clause, and elimination of group rows using the HAVING clause.

SELECT select_list
    FROM ...
    [WHERE ...]
    GROUP BY grouping_column_reference [, grouping_column_reference]...
The GROUP BY Clause is used to group together those rows in a table that have the same values in all the columns listed. The order in which the columns are listed does not matter. The effect is to combine each set of rows having common values into one group row that represents all rows in the group. This is done to eliminate redundancy in the output and/or compute aggregates that apply to these groups. For instance:

=> SELECT * FROM test1;
 x | y
---+---
 a | 3
 c | 2
 b | 5
 a | 1
(4 rows)

=> SELECT x FROM test1 GROUP BY x;
 x
---
 a
 b
 c
(3 rows)
In the second query, we could not have written SELECT * FROM test1 GROUP BY x, because there is no single value for the column y that could be associated with each group. The grouped-by columns can be referenced in the select list since they have a single value in each group.

In general, if a table is grouped, columns that are not listed in GROUP BY cannot be referenced except in aggregate expressions. An example with aggregate expressions is:

=> SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x;
 x | sum
---+-----
 a |   4
 b |   5
 c |   2
(3 rows)
Here sum is an aggregate function that computes a single value over the entire group. More information about the available aggregate functions can be found in Section 9.20.

Tip: Grouping without aggregate expressions effectively calculates the set of distinct values in a column. This can also be achieved using the DISTINCT clause (see Section 7.3.3).
Here is another example: it calculates the total sales for each product (rather than the total sales of all products):

SELECT product_id, p.name, (sum(s.units) * p.price) AS sales
    FROM products p LEFT JOIN sales s USING (product_id)
    GROUP BY product_id, p.name, p.price;
In this example, the columns product_id, p.name, and p.price must be in the GROUP BY clause since they are referenced in the query select list (but see below). The column s.units does not have to be in the GROUP BY list since it is only used in an aggregate expression (sum(...)), which represents the sales of a product. For each product, the query returns a summary row about all sales of the product.

If the products table is set up so that, say, product_id is the primary key, then it would be enough to group by product_id in the above example, since name and price would be functionally dependent on the product ID, and so there would be no ambiguity about which name and price value to return for each product ID group.

In strict SQL, GROUP BY can only group by columns of the source table but PostgreSQL extends this to also allow GROUP BY to group by columns in the select list. Grouping by value expressions instead of simple column names is also allowed.

If a table has been grouped using GROUP BY, but only certain groups are of interest, the HAVING clause can be used, much like a WHERE clause, to eliminate groups from the result. The syntax is:

SELECT select_list FROM ... [WHERE ...] GROUP BY ... HAVING boolean_expression
Expressions in the HAVING clause can refer both to grouped expressions and to ungrouped expressions (which necessarily involve an aggregate function).

Example:

=> SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x HAVING sum(y) > 3;
 x | sum
---+-----
 a |   4
 b |   5
(2 rows)

=> SELECT x, sum(y) FROM test1 GROUP BY x HAVING x < 'c';
 x | sum
---+-----
 a |   4
 b |   5
(2 rows)
Again, a more realistic example:

SELECT product_id, p.name, (sum(s.units) * (p.price - p.cost)) AS profit
    FROM products p LEFT JOIN sales s USING (product_id)
    WHERE s.date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 weeks'
    GROUP BY product_id, p.name, p.price, p.cost
    HAVING sum(p.price * s.units) > 5000;
In the example above, the WHERE clause is selecting rows by a column that is not grouped (the expression is only true for sales during the last four weeks), while the HAVING clause restricts the output to groups with total gross sales over 5000. Note that the aggregate expressions do not necessarily need to be the same in all parts of the query.

If a query contains aggregate function calls, but no GROUP BY clause, grouping still occurs: the result is a single group row (or perhaps no rows at all, if the single row is then eliminated by HAVING). The same is true if it contains a HAVING clause, even without any aggregate function calls or GROUP BY clause.

7.2.4. Window Function Processing

If the query contains any window functions (see Section 3.5, Section 9.21 and Section 4.2.8), these functions are evaluated after any grouping, aggregation, and HAVING filtering is performed. That is, if the query uses any aggregates, GROUP BY, or HAVING, then the rows seen by the window functions are the group rows instead of the original table rows from FROM/WHERE.

When multiple window functions are used, all the window functions having syntactically equivalent PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses in their window definitions are guaranteed to be evaluated in a single pass over the data. Therefore they will see the same sort ordering, even if the ORDER BY does not uniquely determine an ordering. However, no guarantees are made about the evaluation of functions having different PARTITION BY or ORDER BY specifications. (In such cases a sort step is typically required between the passes of window function evaluations, and the sort is not guaranteed to preserve ordering of rows that its ORDER BY sees as equivalent.)

Currently, window functions always require presorted data, and so the query output will be ordered according to one or another of the window functions' PARTITION BY/ORDER BY clauses. It is not recommended to rely on this, however. Use an explicit top-level ORDER BY clause if you want to be sure the results are sorted in a particular way.
