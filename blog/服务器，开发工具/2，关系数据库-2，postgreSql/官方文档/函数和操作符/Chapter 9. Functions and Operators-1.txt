PostgreSQL provides a large number of functions and operators for the built-in data types. Users can also define their own functions and operators, as described in Part V. The psql commands \df and \do can be used to list all available functions and operators, respectively.

If you are concerned about portability then note that most of the functions and operators described in this chapter, with the exception of the most trivial arithmetic and comparison operators and some explicitly marked functions, are not specified by the SQL standard. Some of this extended functionality is present in other SQL database management systems, and in many cases this functionality is compatible and consistent between the various implementations. This chapter is also not exhaustive; additional functions appear in relevant sections of the manual.

====
9.1. Logical Operators
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-logical.html

The usual logical operators are available:

AND
OR
NOTSQL uses a three-valued logic system with true, false, and null, which represents "unknown". Observe the following truth tables:
a	b	a AND b	a OR b
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
TRUE	NULL	NULL	TRUE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
FALSE	NULL	FALSE	NULL
NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL
a	NOT a
TRUE	FALSE
FALSE	TRUE
NULL	NULL
The operators AND and OR are commutative, that is, you can switch the left and right operand without affecting the result. But see Section 4.2.14 for more information about the order of evaluation of subexpressions.

====
9.2. Comparison Operators
The usual comparison operators are available, shown in Table 9-1.

Table 9-1. Comparison Operators

Operator	Description
<	less than
>	greater than
<=	less than or equal to
>=	greater than or equal to
=	equal
<> or !=	not equal
Note: The != operator is converted to <> in the parser stage. It is not possible to implement != and <> operators that do different things.
Comparison operators are available for all relevant data types. All comparison operators are binary operators that return values of type boolean; expressions like 1 < 2 < 3 are not valid (because there is no < operator to compare a Boolean value with 3).

In addition to the comparison operators, the special BETWEEN construct is available:

a BETWEEN x AND y
is equivalent to

a >= x AND a <= y
Notice that BETWEEN treats the endpoint values as included in the range. NOT BETWEEN does the opposite comparison:

a NOT BETWEEN x AND y
is equivalent to

a < x OR a > y
BETWEEN SYMMETRIC is the same as BETWEEN except there is no requirement that the argument to the left of AND be less than or equal to the argument on the right. If it is not, those two arguments are automatically swapped, so that a nonempty range is always implied.

To check whether a value is or is not null, use the constructs:

expression IS NULL
expression IS NOT NULL
or the equivalent, but nonstandard, constructs:

expression ISNULL
expression NOTNULL
Do not write expression = NULL because NULL is not "equal to" NULL. (The null value represents an unknown value, and it is not known whether two unknown values are equal.) This behavior conforms to the SQL standard.

Tip: Some applications might expect that expression = NULL returns true if expression evaluates to the null value. It is highly recommended that these applications be modified to comply with the SQL standard. However, if that cannot be done the transform_null_equals configuration variable is available. If it is enabled, PostgreSQL will convert x = NULL clauses to x IS NULL.
Note: If the expression is row-valued, then IS NULL is true when the row expression itself is null or when all the row's fields are null, while IS NOT NULL is true when the row expression itself is non-null and all the row's fields are non-null. Because of this behavior, IS NULL and IS NOT NULL do not always return inverse results for row-valued expressions, i.e., a row-valued expression that contains both NULL and non-null values will return false for both tests. This definition conforms to the SQL standard, and is a change from the inconsistent behavior exhibited by PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.2.
Ordinary comparison operators yield null (signifying "unknown"), not true or false, when either input is null. For example, 7 = NULL yields null, as does 7 <> NULL. When this behavior is not suitable, use the IS [ NOT ] DISTINCT FROM constructs:

expression IS DISTINCT FROM expression
expression IS NOT DISTINCT FROM expression
For non-null inputs, IS DISTINCT FROM is the same as the <> operator. However, if both inputs are null it returns false, and if only one input is null it returns true. Similarly, IS NOT DISTINCT FROM is identical to = for non-null inputs, but it returns true when both inputs are null, and false when only one input is null. Thus, these constructs effectively act as though null were a normal data value, rather than "unknown".

Boolean values can also be tested using the constructs

expression IS TRUE
expression IS NOT TRUE
expression IS FALSE
expression IS NOT FALSE
expression IS UNKNOWN
expression IS NOT UNKNOWN
These will always return true or false, never a null value, even when the operand is null. A null input is treated as the logical value "unknown". Notice that IS UNKNOWN and IS NOT UNKNOWN are effectively the same as IS NULL and IS NOT NULL, respectively, except that the input expression must be of Boolean type.

====
9.3. Mathematical Functions and Operators
Mathematical operators are provided for many PostgreSQL types. For types without standard mathematical conventions (e.g., date/time types) we describe the actual behavior in subsequent sections.

Table 9-2 shows the available mathematical operators.

Table 9-2. Mathematical Operators

Operator	Description	Example	Result
+	addition	2 + 3	5
-	subtraction	2 - 3	-1
*	multiplication	2 * 3	6
/	division (integer division truncates the result)	4 / 2	2
%	modulo (remainder)	5 % 4	1
^	exponentiation	2.0 ^ 3.0	8
|/	square root	|/ 25.0	5
||/	cube root	||/ 27.0	3
!	factorial	5 !	120
!!	factorial (prefix operator)	!! 5	120
@	absolute value	@ -5.0	5
&	bitwise AND	91 & 15	11
|	bitwise OR	32 | 3	35
#	bitwise XOR	17 # 5	20
~	bitwise NOT	~1	-2
<<	bitwise shift left	1 << 4	16
>>	bitwise shift right	8 >> 2	2
The bitwise operators work only on integral data types, whereas the others are available for all numeric data types. The bitwise operators are also available for the bit string types bit and bit varying, as shown in Table 9-11.

Table 9-3 shows the available mathematical functions. In the table, dp indicates double precision. Many of these functions are provided in multiple forms with different argument types. Except where noted, any given form of a function returns the same data type as its argument. The functions working with double precision data are mostly implemented on top of the host system's C library; accuracy and behavior in boundary cases can therefore vary depending on the host system.

Table 9-4 shows functions for generating random numbers.

Function	Return Type	Description
random()	dp	random value in the range 0.0 <= x < 1.0
setseed(dp)	void	set seed for subsequent random() calls (value between -1.0 and 1.0, inclusive)
The characteristics of the values returned by random() depend on the system implementation. It is not suitable for cryptographic applications; see pgcrypto module for an alternative.

Finally, Table 9-5 shows the available trigonometric functions. All trigonometric functions take arguments and return values of type double precision. Trigonometric functions arguments are expressed in radians. Inverse functions return values are expressed in radians. See unit transformation functions radians() and degrees() above.

acos(x)	inverse cosine
asin(x)	inverse sine
atan(x)	inverse tangent
atan2(y, x)	inverse tangent of y/x
cos(x)	cosine
cot(x)	cotangent
sin(x)	sine
tan(x)	tangent
