==========
The Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) 
are both object model focused query languages similar in nature to SQL. 
JPQL is a heavily-inspired-by subset of HQL. 
A JPQL query is always a valid HQL query, the reverse is not true however.

一个jpql查询总是有效的hql查询，但hql查询则不一定是有效的jpql查询。

Both HQL and JPQL are non-type-safe ways to perform query operations. 
Criteria queries offer a type-safe approach to querying. See ??? for more information.


============
11.1. Case Sensitivity

With the exception of names of Java classes and properties, queries are case-insensitive. 
类名，字段名，大小写相关。
So SeLeCT is the same as sELEct is the same as SELECT, 
but org.hibernate.eg.FOO and org.hibernate.eg.Foo are different, 
as are foo.barSet and foo.BARSET.
关键字，大小写无关。

Note

This documentation uses lowercase keywords as convention in examples.


=============
11.2. Statement types

Both HQL and JPQL allow SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements to be performed. 
HQL additionally allows INSERT statements, in a form similar to a SQL INSERT-SELECT.

hql和jpql都支持select，update，delete语句。
此外，hql还支持insert语句。

Important
注意：

Care should be taken as to when a UPDATE or DELETE statement is executed.
使用 update 和 delete 语句需小心，尤其在批量处理时。
 	 Caution should be used when executing bulk update or delete operations 
 	 because they may result in inconsistencies between the database and the entities in the active persistence context. 
 	 因为它们可能导致数据库和内存中的对象不一致。
 	 In general, bulk update and delete operations should only be performed within a transaction in a new persistence context 
 	 or before fetching or accessing entities whose state might be affected by such operations.	 
 	或者在一个新的事务（新的持久化上下文）中，或者重新读取对象。
 	--Section 4.10 of the JPA 2.0 Specification


-----------
11.2.1. Select statements

The BNF for SELECT statements in HQL is:

select_statement :: =
        [select_clause]
        from_clause
        [where_clause]
        [groupby_clause]
        [having_clause]
        [orderby_clause]

The simplest possible HQL SELECT statement is of the form:

from com.acme.Cat

The select statement in JPQL is exactly the same as for HQL except that JPQL requires a select_clause, 
whereas HQL does not. 
jpql 必须有select语句，而 hql 可以省略。

Even though HQL does not require the presence of a select_clause, 
it is generally good practice to include one. 
For simple queries the intent is clear and so the intended result of the select_clause is east to infer. 
But on more complex queries that is not always the case. 
It is usually better to explicitly specify intent. 
Hibernate does not actually enforce that a select_clause be present even when parsing JPQL queries, 
however applications interested in JPA portability should take heed of this.


-----------
11.2.2. Update statements

The BNF for UPDATE statements is the same in HQL and JPQL:

update_statement ::= update_clause [where_clause]

update_clause ::= UPDATE entity_name [[AS] identification_variable]
        SET update_item {, update_item}*

update_item ::= [identification_variable.]{state_field | single_valued_object_field}
        = new_value

new_value ::= scalar_expression |
                simple_entity_expression |
                NULL


UPDATE statements, by default, do not effect the version or the timestamp attribute values for the affected entities. 

默认情况下，update语句不影响实体的版本号和时间戳。

However, you can force Hibernate to set the version or timestamp attribute values through the use of a versioned update.
This is achieved by adding the VERSIONED keyword after the UPDATE keyword. 

但通过使用 versioned 关键字，你可以让hibernate强制更新实体的版本号和时间戳。
 
Note, however, that this is a Hibernate specific feature and will not work in a portable manner.
这是hibernate特有的功能。 
Custom version types, org.hibernate.usertype.UserVersionType, 
are not allowed in conjunction with a update versioned statement.
如果是自定义版本类型，则不允许使用 versioned 关键字。

An UPDATE statement is executed using the executeUpdate of either org.hibernate.Query or javax.persistence.Query. 
The method is named for those familiar with the JDBC executeUpdate on java.sql.PreparedStatement. 
The int value returned by the executeUpdate() method indicates the number of entities effected by the operation.
返回值为受影响的行数，这可能是不准确的。 
This may or may not correlate to the number of rows effected in the database. 
An HQL bulk operation might result in multiple actual SQL statements being executed (for joined-subclass, for example).
在底层，可能会执行多条sql语句。 
The returned number indicates the number of actual entities affected by the statement. 
Using a JOINED inheritance hierarchy, a delete against one of the subclasses
如果使用“联合”继承策略，一个删除语句，会包括子类在内。 
may actually result in deletes against not just the table to which that subclass is mapped, 
but also the "root" table and tables “in between”


Example 11.1. Example UPDATE query statements
示例：

String hqlUpdate =
		"update Customer c " +
		"set c.name = :newName " +
		"where c.name = :oldName";
int updatedEntities = session.createQuery( hqlUpdate )
        .setString( "newName", newName )
        .setString( "oldName", oldName )
        .executeUpdate();

String jpqlUpdate =
		"update Customer c " +
		"set c.name = :newName " +
		"where c.name = :oldName";
int updatedEntities = entityManager.createQuery( jpqlUpdate )
        .setString( "newName", newName )
        .setString( "oldName", oldName )
        .executeUpdate();

String hqlVersionedUpdate =
		"update versioned Customer c " +
		"set c.name = :newName " +
		"where c.name = :oldName";
int updatedEntities = s.createQuery( hqlUpdate )
        .setString( "newName", newName )
        .setString( "oldName", oldName )
        .executeUpdate();


Important
注意：

Neither UPDATE nor DELETE statements are allowed to result in what is called an implicit join. 
Their form already disallows explicit joins.
update 和 delete 语句都不支持 隐式join，它们的from子句已经阻止 隐式join。


-----------
11.2.3. Delete statements
删除语句

The BNF for DELETE statements is the same in HQL and JPQL:

delete_statement ::= delete_clause [where_clause]

delete_clause ::= DELETE FROM entity_name [[AS] identification_variable]

A DELETE statement is also executed using the executeUpdate method 
of either org.hibernate.Query or javax.persistence.Query.


-----------
11.2.4. Insert statements
插入语句（insert...select）

HQL adds the ability to define INSERT statements as well. 
There is no JPQL equivalent to this.
jpql没有此功能。 

The BNF for an HQL INSERT statement is:
语法：

insert_statement ::= insert_clause select_statement

insert_clause ::= INSERT INTO entity_name (attribute_list)

attribute_list ::= state_field[, state_field ]*


The attribute_list is analogous to the column specification in the SQL INSERT statement. 

For entities involved in mapped inheritance, 
only attributes directly defined on the named entity can be used in the attribute_list.
属性列表，只能包括本实体定义的字段，不能含有继承而来的。 

Superclass properties are not allowed and subclass properties do not make sense. 

In other words, INSERT statements are inherently non-polymorphic.
即，插入语句是非多态的。

select_statement can be any valid HQL select query, 
with the caveat that the return types must match the types expected by the insert. 

Currently, this is checked during query compilation rather than allowing the check to relegate to the database.
类型匹配检查是在hibernate层，而不是数据库层。 
This may cause problems between Hibernate Types which are equivalent as opposed to equal. 
For example, this might cause lead to issues with mismatches 
between an attribute mapped as a org.hibernate.type.DateType 
and an attribute defined as a org.hibernate.type.TimestampType, 
even though the database might not make a distinction or might be able to handle the conversion.
所以，可能底层数据库不区分日期和时间戳，但hibernate区分。

For the id attribute, the insert statement gives you two options. 
You can either explicitly specify the id property in the attribute_list, 
in which case its value is taken from the corresponding select expression, 
or omit it from the attribute_list in which case a generated value is used. 
This latter option is only available when using id generators that operate “in the database”;
如果id是自动生成的，必须是数据库层生成的。 
attempting to use this option with any “in memory” type generators will cause an exception during parsing.
如果id是在内存中生成，会抛出异常。

For optimistic locking attributes, the insert statement again gives you two options.
对于优化锁版本字段，同样有两种方案。 
You can either specify the attribute in the attribute_list in which case its value is taken from the corresponding select expressions, 
or omit it from the attribute_list in which case the seed value defined by the corresponding org.hibernate.type.VersionType is used.


Example 11.2. Example INSERT query statements
示例：

String hqlInsert = "insert into DelinquentAccount (id, name) select c.id, c.name from Customer c where ...";
int createdEntities = s.createQuery( hqlInsert ).executeUpdate();
