第2节，动词的种类及其用法

=============
8，授予动词

授予动词需要接两个宾语，
直接宾语，表授予的东西（说话人先接触的是东西），间接宾语，授予的对象。

I will give you this watch.

Please lend me your book.

I asked him a question.

====
8.1，间接宾语与直接宾语的倒置原则

需要另加介词to，for，of。

-1，表“给予”，用to。

I gave him the book.
=I gave the book to him.

I sent the letter to him.
I told him the story.
I teach English to them.

-2，表“代劳”，用for。

I bought him the book.
=I bought the book for him.

-3，表“从...中”，用of。

I asked him a question.
=I asked a question of him.

此处的of，等于from之意，但使用时，用of为宜。
凡表“要求”的动词，都是这种用法。

I didn't expect much of him.
我对他不抱很大的期望。

He required nothing of me.
他对我毫无所求。

He demanded little of me.
他对我几无所求。

上面三个动词，不能像ask一样，将间接宾语放在前面。

====
8.2，与of连用的授予动词

与上面不同，of之后是表“东西”的名词为宾语，而不是“对象”。

rob，抢夺
He robbed me of my money.
I was robbed of my money.

deprive，剥夺（权利）
The court deprived him of all his civil rights.
法院剥夺了他的公民权利。
He was deprived/stripped of all his civil rights.

relieve，解除（职务，指挥权等）
The captain relieved the platton leader of his command.

==
rid，解除，摆脱
I cannot rid myself of the painful memory.
=I cannot get rid of the painful memory.

rid三态同形。
rid myself of中的rid是动词，表“使脱离”。
get rid of中的rid是过去分词，相当于形容词，表“脱离的”。
get相当于be，但get rid of表“动作”，be rid of表“状态”（已摆脱）。

I'll get rid of those chores.
我要摆脱那些杂务。
I'am glad to be rid of those chores.
我很高兴摆脱了那些杂务。

==
break，戒除

You should break/rid yourself of the bad habit of smoking.
但也可写出：
You should break the bad habit of smoking.

cure，治愈
The doctor cured him of his disease.
但也可写成：
The doctor cured his disease.

====
8.3，表“提供”的授予动词

offer，provide，supply，furnish，present等。
除了offer，都要与介词with连用。

He offered me all I needed.

He provided/supplied/furnished me with all I needed.

注意：
He offered me all I needed.
=He offered all I needed to me.

He provided me with all I needed.
=He provided all I needed for me.

offer还可表示“愿意，主动提议”，此时接不定式短语作宾语。
offer to v，愿意做某事。
=be willing to v.

After he heard of my situation,he offered to help me.

present（赠与）的用法与provide相似，不同的是，将间接宾语放在句尾时，要用介词to。

He presented me with a watch.
=He presented a watch to me.

====
8.4，补充

前面讲，表“给与”时，用与to连用。
但，explain（解释），introduce（介绍），propose（提议），
recommend（建议），express（表示）等动词，
不论间接和直接宾语是否颠倒，总是要用 to 。

He explained the reason to me.
=He explained to me the reason.（少用）

He introduced the girl to me.
=He introduced to me the girl.（少用）

He recommended the method to me.
=He recommended to me the method.（少用）

He proposed a motion to the committee.
=He proposed to the committee a motion.（少用）

比较下列两句的不同：

I took a picture of him.
照片中有他。

I took a picture for him.
照片中不一定有他。
