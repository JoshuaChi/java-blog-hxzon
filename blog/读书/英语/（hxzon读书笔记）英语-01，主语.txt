第一章，句子的形成

第1节，可作主语的词类

1，动名词或不定式作主语
动词绝不可直接作主语，必须变成动名词或不定式短语。

动名词作主语，通常表示已知的事实，或曾经做过的经验。
不定式作主语，通常表示一种意愿，目的，未完成的事。

1.1，
不定式或动名词短语作主语时，往往会形成主语太长的现象，故通常均用代词it作“形式主语”，
置于句首而将“真正主语”（亦即不定式或动名词短语）移至句
尾。
动名词移至句尾时，通常改为不定式短语。

Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies .
＝It is one of his hobbies to collect stamps.

有时我们亦可见到被it代替的动名词短语移至句尾时，仍保留动名词形态而不变
成不定式短语。
但此种用法并不普遍，初学语法者宜尽量避免。

特殊情况：
下列句型则属例外情形，it要代替动名词短语，不可使用不定式短语：
It is no use＋动名词短语
It is no use crying over spilt milk .
（覆水难收。）
It is no use asking him for help.
（向他求救是没有用的。）

注意：
It is no use+动名词短语
=It is useless+不定式短语
=It is of no use+不定式短语
=There is no use/sense/point in + 动名词短语

====
2，名词性从句作主语
句子决不能作主语，要变成名词性从句。

名词性从句一共三种：
-1，that从句
-2，whether从句
-3，疑问词所引导的从句

2.1，that从句
He doesn't believe my words .（句子）
that he doesn't believe my words（名词性从句）

2.2，whether从句（用yes,no回答的问句）
Is he happy?
whether he is happy

Can he do it?
whether he can do it

Has he dont it?
whether he has dont it

问句有do，does，did等助动词，去掉，
后面的动词依人称，时态变化。

Did he come?
whether he came

Does he like it?
whether he likes it

2.3，疑问词从句（特殊疑问句）
what is he doing?
what he is doing

where can he find it?
where he can find it

含有do，does，did等助动词时，去掉，动词依人称和时态变化。

What did he write?
what he wrote

When did he come?
when he came

How does he do it?
how he does it

注意：
who,what,which为疑问代词，若在问句中作主语，变成名词性从句时，结构不变。

Who came here?
who came here

What happened last night?
what happened last night

Which was bought?
which was bought

一如动名词或不定式短语，名词性从句作主语时容易造成主语太长的现象，
因此亦可用形式主语it代替，置于句首，
而被代替的名词性从句则置于句尾。

That honesty is the best policy
is a proverb (which) we should always keep in mind.
=It is proverb we should always keep in mind
that honesty is the best policy.

==
2.4，名词性从句，作介词的宾语
此时，仅能用whether从句或疑问词引导的名词性从句作宾语，
that从句不可作介词的宾语。

遇到介词，且非要使用that从句时，补救方法如下：

-1，方法一，介词+the fact+that从句
that从句变成the fact的同位语。

-2，方法二，介词之后的that从句，做如下变化：
移除that。
that后的主语变成所有格。
动词变成动名词。

that he plays around all day
=>I am worried about his playing around all day.

that从句若有助动词do，does，did时，去掉。
that he doesn't study
=>I am worried about his not studying.

that从句若有助动词will，would时，去掉。
that the team will win the game
=>I am sure of the team's winning the game.

that从句有以下助动词时，如下变化：
may-> be likely to
can-> he able to
再将be动词变成动名词being。

that he may come
->I am happy about his being likely to come.

that he is able to do it
->I am sure of his being able to do it.

-3，方法三，be+adj.+that从句
即去掉介词，将that从句放在形容词后，作其宾语。

I am worried about that he plays around all day.（误）
I am worried that he plays around all day.
worried是形容词。

I am sure of that the team has won the game.（误）
I am sure that the team has won the game.
sure是形容词。

特殊情况：惯用语。
in that=because
He is talented in that he can speak five different languages.

except that，只可惜，除了...
He is nice except that sometimes he lies.

notwithstanding that，尽管。
=despite the fact that
=in spite of the fact that

Notwithstanding that he is nice,I don't like him.

====
3，名词短语作主语

名词短语，即“疑问词+不定式短语”。

疑问副词
where to live
whether to try again
when to talk to him
how to do it

疑问代词
what to do
whom to see
which to buy
whom to talk to

疑问副词形成的名词短语中疑问副词因为是副词的性质，
故不作不定式短语中及物动词的宾语。
但疑问代词形成的名词短语中J疑问代词因具名词的性质，
故一定要作不定式短语中动词或介词的宾语。
故what 、 whom 、 which在上列名词短语中，
分别作do 、 see 、 buy 、 to（介词）的宾语。

名词短语因具名词性质，故亦可作主语，
系由名词性从句化简而成。

====
4，表距离的地方副词短语，作主语

from+地方名词+to+地方名词

此为表距离的地方副词短语，亦可作主语，
与单数的be动词连用。

From Shanghai to Beijing is about 1000 kilometers.
=It is about 1000 kilometers from Shanghai to Beijing.
