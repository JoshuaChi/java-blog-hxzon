6，完全及物动词
这里只讲主动语态。

主语+完全及物动词+宾语

==
不定式当及物动词的宾语，表示某种愿望，企图，例如
want，hope，desire。

I want to see him now.

==
动名词作及物动词的宾语

He considered studying abroad.

I once imagined going on a date with him.

I just can't fancy getting along with them.

He risked doing it.

I avoided seeing him again.

He escaped being killed in the accident.
他在那次意外中幸免于难。

They suggested putting off the game.

He recommended traveling abroad.

I enjoy dancing.

I resent having to do so much work.

I practiced playing the piano.

He stopped/quit smoking.

Would you mind opening the window for me?

注意：
resist v-ing，抗拒
refuse to v ，拒绝

expect to v，期望
=anticipate v-ing

stop v-ing，停止
=quit v-ing
=cease v-ing
=cease to v

stop to v，停下来而去
（hxzon：停下原有的事，做v这件事）

He stopped to talk to me when he saw me.
=He stopped (what he was doing)to talk to me when he saw me.
他看见我时，便停下来和我说话。

continue（继续），start（开始），begin（开始），
like（喜欢），love（爱），hate（憎），
可用不定式或动名词作宾语，意思相同。

He continued trying/to try his luck at the casino.

They started building/to build the house.

I like/love/hate listening/to listen to music.

==
名词性从句作及物动词的宾语。

that从句作及物动词宾语时，连接词that通常可省略。

They feel (that) it is impossible to win the game.

He thinks (that) the book is worth reading.

whether从句作及物动词宾语时，连接词whether可被if取代。

I don't know whether the typhoon will come.
=I don't know if the typhoon will come.

但whether从句作主语、介词的宾语，或be动词后的表语时，
whether不可被if取代。

He is worried about whether he can pass the exam.

The problem is whether he has enough money for the trip.

==============
7，不完全及物动词

此类动词加了宾语后，意思仍不完整，需要加补语。

make，制造，做，此时为完全及物动词。
He made a kite.

make，使，叫，不完全及物动词。

He made Mary happy.
他使玛丽快乐。
happy作宾语补语。

He made Mary clean the window.
他叫玛丽擦窗子。

====
7.1，使役动词

make/have +宾语+原形动词（做补语）

I made him wash the car.

I had John report to me.
我叫约翰向我报到。

get也可表使役之意，但只能用不定式短语作宾语补语。
get sb to v，叫某人做某事。
I got him to wash the car.
我叫他洗车。

make可用于被动语态，但have，get不可。
变成被动语态时，要用不定式短语。
He was made to wash the car.

==
let，让

let+宾语+原形动词（作宾语补语）

I let him wash the car.
I let Peter try it.

let+宾语+作副词用的介词（in，out，down）

He let me in.
Don't let him out.
His performance let me down.
他的表演令我失望。

注意，上述介词由于其后无宾语，可单独存在作副词使用，因此成为“介副词”。
与“地方副词”（there，here，home）一样，可作be动词之后的表语。

He is in.
他在家。

He is out.
他出去了。

但在let之后，只能用“介副词”作补语，不可用地方副词。
He let me in.

let之后若用原形动词做补语，变被动语态时，
该原形动词要变成不定式短语，然而该用法已不多见。
I let him wash the car.
-> He was let to wash the car.
很少人会这么说。

==
强迫，要求，怂恿，催促+宾语+不定式短语（作宾语补语）
