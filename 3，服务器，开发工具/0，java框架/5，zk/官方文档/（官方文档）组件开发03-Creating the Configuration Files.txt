（官方文档）组件开发03-Creating the Configuration Files

注释by hxzon
====
In order for our component to be used in ZK applications 
we need to provide two component files named language-addon and zk.wpd.
使用自定义组件，必须创建两个配置文件。

Subsections:
The language-addon
The Widget Package Descriptor

=========
The language-addon

The language-addon contains a description of the relation between the component and widget referred to as the component definition. 
The path of the file must be /metainfo/zk/lang-addon.xml and be located in the Java class path.

<language-addon>
	<addon-name>simplelabel</addon-name>
	<language-name>xul/html</language-name>
 
	<component>
		<component-name>simplelabel</component-name>
		<component-class>com.foo.SimpleLabel</component-class>
		<widget-class>com.foo.SimpleLabel</widget-class>
		<mold>
			<mold-name>default</mold-name>
			<mold-uri>mold/simple-label.js</mold-uri>
			<css-uri>css/simple-label.css.dsp</css-uri>
		</mold>
	</component>
</language-addon>

The table below describes the elements used within the above XML and their descriptions.

Name	 Description

addon-name	 
A unique name for this addon

annotation	
Annotation setting for Data Binding

language-name	 
The language name that this addon belongs to (for instance, xul/html or zhtml)

component-name	 
A unique name of the component in the language of this addon

component-class	 
The name of the component class (Java class)

widget-class	 
The name of the widget class (JavaScript class)

mold	 
A mold definition (optional)

mold-name	 
The name of the mold. The default mold is named default.

mold-uri	 
The URI of the mold

css-uri	 
The URI of the CSS file for the mold

A component may have multiple molds which may or may not have different widget classes. 
To handle this you may specify the <widget-class> inside <mold>. 
You can specify more than one mold.
如果一个组件的每个“模子”对应不同的部件类，则把部件类写在“模子”中。

After creating the component descriptor language-addon 
we need to create the widget package descriptor.
For more information, please refer to ZK Client-side Reference: Language Definition.

====
The Widget Package Descriptor

The Widget Package Descriptor (WPD) is a file describing the information of a package, 
such as its widget classes and external JavaScript files. 
WPD must be named zk.wpd and placed in the same directory as the widget classes. 
For example we would place it under web/js/com/foo.
部件包描述文件，和部件类一起。

Below is an example zk.wpd of our SimpleLabel.

<package name="com.foo" language="xul/html">
    <widget name="SimpleLabel"/>
</package>

The table below describes the elements used within the above XML and their description.

Name	 Description

package	 
The root element denotes the package name and the language it belongs to

widget	 
The widget class name (without the package name). 
If the package contains multiple widgets list them one by one

Having created the configuration the basic implementation of our component is complete. 
However it will not have any interactive events. 
Therefore the next logical step is to start adding events to the component.
为组件添加事件交互。

Package Dependence
It is common for JavaScript packages to depend on another package. 
For example, zul.grid depends on zul.mesh and zul.menu. 
This can easily be specified by placing them within the depends attribute as follows.
部件之间的依赖。

<package name="zul.grid" language="xul/html" depends="zul.mesh,zul.menu">
    <widget name="Column"/>
    <widget name="Columns"/>
    <widget name="Grid"/>
    <widget name="Row"/>
    <widget name="Rows"/>
    <widget name="Foot"/>
    <widget name="Footer"/>
</package>

Including additonal JavaScript files
If a JavaScript package has to include other JavaScript files, 
this can be done easily by specifying the file with the script element. 
For example, the following is the content of zul.db's WPD:
包含额外的js文件：

<package name="zul.db" language="xul/html" depends="zk.fmt,zul.inp">
    <script src="datefmt.js"/>
    <widget name="Calendar"/>
    <widget name="Datebox"/>
</package>
