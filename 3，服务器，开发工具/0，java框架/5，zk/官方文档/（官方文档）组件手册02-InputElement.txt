Input Element

Demonstration: N/A

Java API: InputElement

JavaScript API: InputWidget
http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/jsdoc/zul/inp/InputWidget.html

====
Employment/Purpose

InputElement is a super class for components which prove user key input, 
such as textbox, intbox, decimalbox, doublebox, datebox, timebox, spinner, combobox, and bandbox.
Some features are implemented in this class, such as constraint, disabled, maxlength, name, readonly, and so on.
You should not use this class directly, please use the inherited class.
Example

<grid>
    <rows>
        <row>
            UserName <textbox value="Jerry" width="150px" />
        </row>
        <row>
            Password <textbox type="password" value="foo" width="150px" />
        </row>
        <row>
            Phone: <intbox constraint="no negative,no zero" width="150px" value="12345678" />
        </row>
        <row>
            Weight: <decimalbox format="###.##" value="154.32" width="150px" />
        </row>
        <row>
            Birthday: <datebox id="db" width="150px" />           
        </row>
        <row>
            E-mail:
            <textbox width="150px" value="zk@zkoss.org"
                constraint="/.+@.+\.[a-z]+/: Please enter an e-mail address" />
        </row>
    </rows>
</grid>

====
Validation
输入校验

There are two ways to validate the value entered by an user: 
有两种方式来实现输入校验：
implementing Constraint or throwing WrongValueException.

==
Constraint
约束

（hxzon：默认的实现，即 SimpleConstraint ，在客户端完成校验。）

An input element can be associated with a constraint (Constraint) to validate the value entered by an user. 
There is a default implementation called SimpleConstraint that can handle many conditions. 
If it is not enough, you can implement your own constraint, or throwing WrongValueException as described in the next sections.
To use the default constraint, you could specify a list of conditions in InputElement.setConstraint(String), 
such as no positive and no empty. For example,

<textbox constraint="no empty"/>
<intbox constraint="no negative,no zero"/>

To specify a regular expression, you could have to use / to enclose the regular expression as follows.
正则表达式约束：

<textbox constraint="/.+@.+\.[a-z]+/"/>

Notice that the above statement is XML, so do not use \\ to specify a backslash. 
On the other hand, it is required, if writing in Java:

new Textbox().setContraint("/.+@.+\\.[a-z]+/");

Notice that it is allowed to mix regular expression with other constraints by separating them with comma.

==
If you prefer to display an application dependent message instead of default one, 
you could append the constraint with colon and the message you want to display when failed.
自定义消息提示，用冒号隔开。

<textbox constraint="/.+@.+\.[a-z]+/: e-mail address only"/>
<datebox constraint="no empty, no future: now or never"/>

Notice that the error message, if specified, must be the last element and start with colon. 
注意，错误消息提示，必须位于最后。
To support multilingual, you could use the l function as depicted in ZK Developer's Reference.
如果想支持多种语言，可以使用 l 函数。

<?taglib uri="http://www.zkoss.org/dsp/web/core" prefix="c"?>
<textbox constraint="/.+@.+\.[a-z]+/: ${c:l('err.email.required')}"/>

==
Condition	 Description
约束选项

The default constraints
no empty	 
Empty is not allowed.

no future	 
Date in the future is not allowed.

no negative	 
Negative numbers are not allowed.

no past	 
Date in the past is not allowed.

no positive	 
Postive numbers are not allowed.

no today	 
Today is not allowed.

no zero	 
Zero numbers are not allowed.

between yyyyMMdd and yyyyMMdd	 
Date only allowed between the specified range. 
The format must be yyyyMMdd, such as

<datebox constraint="between 20071225 and 20071203"/>

after yyyyMMdd	 
Date only allowed after (and including) the specified date. 
The format must be yyyyMMdd, such as

<datebox constraint="after 20071225"/>

before yyyyMMdd	 
Date only allowed before (and including) the specified date. 
The format must be yyyyMMdd, such as

<datebox constraint="before 20071225"/>


==
end_before
end_after
after_start
after_end
...

Specifies the position of the error box. 
Please refer to Popup for all allowed position.
指定提示框的位置：

<textbox constraint="no empty, end_after"/>
<textbox constraint="no empty, start_before"/>

==
Custom Constraint
自定义约束

If you want a custom constraint, you could implement Constraint and specify it in the constraint property (InputElement.setConstraint(Constraint)).
实现 Constraint 接口。

public class EventNumberConstraint implements Constraint {
    public void validate(Component comp, Object value) throws WrongValueException {
        if (value != null && (value.intValue() & 1) != 0) //assume used with intbox
            throw new WrongValueException(comp, "Only even numbers are allowed, not "+value);
    }
}

If the validation fails, just throw WrongValue to indicate it. 
Notice that you have to specify which component causes the exception as shown in line 5.
To specify it to the constraint property, you have to instantiate it first by use of the new function as shown below

<?taglib uri="http://www.zkoss.org/dsp/web/core" prefix="c"?>
<textbox constraint="${c:new('foo.EventNumberConstraint')}"/>

==
Display Error Message in Custom Way
定制消息提示样式

Instead of the default error box, you could provide a custom approach by implementing CustomConstraint (with Constraint). 
实现 CustomConstraint 和 Constraint 接口。
Then, CustomConstraint.showCustomError(Component, WrongValueException) 
will be invoked when an exception is caught. For example,

<window title="Custom Constraint" border="normal">
    <zscript><![CDATA[
        class MyConst implements Constraint, CustomConstraint {
            //Constraint//
            public void validate(Component comp, Object value) {
                if (value == null || ((Integer)value).intValue() < 100)
                    throw new WrongValueException(comp, "At least 100 must be specified");
            }
            //CustomConstraint//
            public void showCustomError(Component comp, WrongValueException ex) {
                errmsg.setValue(ex != null ? ex.getMessage(): "");    // errmsg是label组件的id
            }
        }
        Constraint ctt = new MyConst();
    ]]>
    </zscript>
    <hlayout>
        Enter a number at least 100:
        <intbox constraint="${ctt}" />
        <label id="errmsg" />
    </hlayout>
</window>

And, here is the result

==
Validate at Client for Better Responsiveness
在浏览器端校验

Responsiveness could be improved by validating more constraints at the client side[1]. 
To do it, you have to implement ClientConstraint (with Constraint).
实现 ClientConstraint 接口。
↑ The default constraint (SimpleConstraint) validates all constraints at the client side
默认的实现，SimpleConstraint，在客户端完成校验。

====
WrongValueException

In addition to throwing WrongValueException in Constraint.validate(Component, Object), 
you can throw WrongValueException in other situations. 
For example, you can validate the user name and password when the user presses the login button. For example,

public class FooComposer extends SelectorComposer {
  @Wire
  private Textbox username;
  @Wire
  private Textbox password;
 
  @Listen("onClick = #login")
  public void doLogin() {
    username.clearErrorMessage(); //important to clear the previous error, if any
    if (examine(username, password)) {
      //success
    } else {
      throw new WrongValueException(username, "Not a valid username or password. Please retry.");
    }
  }
}

However, notice that you have to clear the error message manually by invoking InputElement.clearErrorMessage(). 
Otherwise, the error message will remain there unless Textbox.setValue(String) is called.

（hxzon疑问：抛出异常，这个错误消息在界面的哪个位置显示？）

属性

Inplace
All input elements can have the in-place-editing functionality, like the combobox, textbox, datebox, and so on.
原位进入编辑模式。

<grid width="500px">
    <rows>
        <row>
            Textbox:
            <textbox inplace="true" value="Click me" />
        </row>
        <row>
            Combobox:
            <combobox inplace="true" value="Click me" />
        </row>
    </rows>
</grid>

==
Instant
值变化立即传送到服务端。

The feature is available since 6.0.0. 
When instant mode is on, 
the onChange event will be fired as soon as possible as user types in the input (like onChanging event). 
The value will also be updated to the component (server side) immediately.

==
Placeholder
since 6.5.0
占位值

ZK 6.5 introduces support for HTML5 placeholder text, 
a very useful feature for telling users what they should enter in a textbox. 
This is a widely regarded UI pattern.
The following image and code show the look of the placeholder as well as the code to replicate it.

<textbox placeholder="Please type some text" />

====
Supported Events
支持的事件

Name
Event Type

onChange
Event: InputEvent
Denotes the content of an input component has been modified by the user.

onChanging
Event: InputEvent
Denotes that user is changing the content of an input component. 
Notice that the component's content (at the server) won't be changed until onChange is received. 
Thus, you have to invoke the getValue method in the InputEvent class to retrieve the temporary value.

onSelection
Event: SelectionEvent
Denotes that user is selecting a portion of the text of an input component. 
You can retrieve the start and end position of the selected text by use of the getStart and getEnd methods.

onFocus
Event: Event
Denotes when a component gets the focus. 
Remember event listeners execute at the server, 
so the focus at the client might be changed when the event listener for onFocus got executed.

onBlur
Event: Event
Denotes when a component loses the focus. 
Remember event listeners execute at the server, 
so the focus at the client might be changed when the event listener for onBlur got executed.

onError
Event: ErrorEvent
Denotes when a component caused a validation error.
